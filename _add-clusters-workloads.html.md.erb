    1. Add more workloads and create an additional cluster. For more information, see
<a href="maintain-uptime.html#upgrades">About Workload Upgrades</a> in _Maintaining Workload Uptime_ and
<a href="create-cluster.html">Creating Clusters</a>.
    1. Monitor the PKS control plane in the <strong><%= vars.product_tile %></strong> tile > <strong>Status</strong> tab.
    Review the load and resource usage data for the PKS API and PKS Database VMs.
    If any levels are at capacity, scale the VMs up.
