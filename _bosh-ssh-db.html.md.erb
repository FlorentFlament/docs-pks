1. Log in to the BOSH Director. For instructions, see [Log in to the BOSH Director VM](diagnostic-tools.html#alias).

1. To identify your PKS deployment name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments</pre>

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is your BOSH environment alias.
  <br>
  <br>
    For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
      Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes
      a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To identify your PKS DB VM names, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>

    Where:
     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre>

    Your PKS DB VM names begin with `pks-db` and include a
    BOSH-generated identifier.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PKS DB VM identifier is different from the identifier in your PKS
    deployment name.
    </p>

1. Choose one of the returned `pks-db` VMs as the database VM to SSH into.  
1. To SSH into the selected `pks-db` VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-DB-VM</pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.
    * `PKS-DB-VM` is the name of the PKS DB VM to SSH into.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pks-db/000a4444-555b-6666-4cc5-de66f8a9900b</pre>
