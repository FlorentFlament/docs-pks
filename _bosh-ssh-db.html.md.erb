     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service-a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre>

    Your <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM name begins with `pks-db` and includes a
    BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-DB-VM</pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.
    * `PKS-DB-VM` is the name of the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM to SSH into.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pivotal-container-service-a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pks-db/000a4444-555b-6666-4cc5-de66f8a9900b</pre>
