     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS MySQL deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pks-db/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre>

    Your PKS DB VM name begins with `pks-db` and includes a

    deployment name.

1. To SSH into the PKS DB VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-DB-VM</pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.
    * `PKS-DB-VM` is your PKS DB VM name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pks-db/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pks-db/000a4444-555b-6666-4cc5-de66f8a9900b</pre>
