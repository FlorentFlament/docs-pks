1. If you have not already done so, gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into
the Ops Manager VM, and use BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops
Manager VM. For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).

1. To identify your PKS deployment name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments</pre>

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias you set in [Set a BOSH Environment Alias and Log in to the BOSH Director VM](diagnostic-tools.html#alias).
  <br>
  <br>
    For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
      Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes
  a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To identify your PKS API VM name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>

    Where:
     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre>

    Your PKS API VM name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a
    BOSH-generated identifier.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PKS API VM identifier is different from the identifier in your PKS
    deployment name.
    </p>

1. To SSH into the PKS API VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-API-VM</pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.
    * `PKS-API-VM` is your PKS API VM name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pivotal-container-service/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b</pre>
