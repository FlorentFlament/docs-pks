Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.
To configure which post-deploy and pre-delete errands run for <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Make a selection in the dropdown next to each errand.

    We recommend that you use the default settings for all errands except for the **Run smoke tests** errand.
1. Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**.

    This errand uses the PKS CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it.
    If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> is enabled, updating the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a new Linux stemcell triggers the rolling of every Linux VM in each Kubernetes cluster. Similarly, updating the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a new Windows stemcell triggers the rolling of every Windows VM in your Kubernetes clusters. This automatic rolling ensures that all your VMs are patched. To avoid workload downtime, use the resource configuration recommended in <a href="understanding-upgrades.html#upgrade-all">What Happens During <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades</a> and <a href="maintain-uptime.html">Maintaining Workload Uptime</a>.</p>
