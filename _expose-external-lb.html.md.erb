#### <a id='external-lb-configure'></a>Configure Your Workload

1. Open your workload's kubernetes service configuration file in an editor. 

1. To expose the workload through a load balancer, modify the Service object to be `type: LoadBalancer`.  
<br>
    For example:

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: nginx
      name: nginx
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 80
      selector:
        app: nginx
      type: LoadBalancer
    ---
    ```

1. Save.
1. Edit each workload's kubernetes service configurations to be `type: LoadBalancer`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For an example of a fully configured kubernetes service, see the 
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-ci/blob/master/specs/nginx-lb.yml">nginx app's example <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> configuration</a> in GitHub. </p>

For more information about configuring the `LoadBalancer` Service type see the 
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-loadbalancer).

#### <a id='external-lb-deploy'></a>Deploy and Expose Your Workload

1. To deploy the service configuration for your workload, run the following command:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f SERVICE-CONFIG
    ```

    Where `SERVICE-CONFIG` is your workload's kubernetes service configuration.  
<br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">kubectl apply -f nginx.yml</pre>
    This command creates three pods, "_replicas_", spanning three follower nodes.

1. Deploy your applications, deployments, config maps, persistent volumes, secrets, 
and any other configurations or objects necessary for your applications to run.

1. Wait until your cloud provider has created and connected a dedicated load balancer to the follower nodes on a specific port.

#### <a id='external-lb-access'></a>Access Your Workload

1. To determine your exposed workload's load balancer IP address and port number, run the following command:

    ```
    kubectl get svc WORKLOAD-NAME
    ```
    Where `WORKLOAD-NAME` is your workload configuration's specified `app`.  
<br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">kubectl get svc nginx</pre>

1. Retrieve the load balancer's external IP and port from the returned listing.

1. To access the app, run the following on the command:

    ```
    curl http://EXTERNAL-IP:PORT
    ```
    Where:  
    * `EXTERNAL-IP` is the IP address of the load balancer 
    * `PORT` is the port number.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This command should be run on a server with network connectivity and visibility to the IP address of the follower node.</p>
