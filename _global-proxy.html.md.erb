    Production environments can deny direct access to public Internet services and between internal services by placing an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in the network path between Kubernetes nodes and those services.  
<br>
    Configuring <%= vars.product_short %> to use these 
    proxies allows <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes nodes to access public Internet services 
    and other internal services. 
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting will not set the proxy for running Kubernetes workloads or pods.  
    </p>
    To complete your global proxy configuration for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters, perform the following steps:  
<br>
    1. To proxy outgoing HTTP traffic, enter the URL of your HTTP proxy endpoint under **HTTP Proxy URL**. 
    For example, `http\://myproxy.com:1234`.
    1. (Optional) If your HTTP proxy uses basic authentication, 
    enter the username and password in the **HTTP Proxy Credentials** fields.  
    1. To proxy outgoing HTTPS traffic, enter the URL of your HTTPS proxy endpoint under **HTTPS Proxy URL**. 
    For example, `https\://myproxy.com:1234`.    
    1. (Optional) If your HTTPS proxy uses basic authentication, 
    enter the username and password in the **HTTPS Proxy Credentials** fields.    
    1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your <%= vars.product_short %> 
    cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses or domain names that should bypass the proxy. 
    The **No Proxy** property for vSphere accepts wildcard domains denoted by a prefixed `\*.` or `.`, 
    for example `\*.example.com` and `.example.com`.  
<br>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the <code>.internal</code>, <code>10.100.0.0/8</code>, and <code>10.200.0.0/8</code> IP address ranges are not proxied. This allows internal <%= vars.product_short %> communication.
    <br><br>
    Do not use the <code>-</code> character in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field. Entering an
    underscore character in this field can cause upgrades to fail.
    <br><br>
    Because some jobs in the VMs accept `\*.` as a wildcard, while others only accept `.`, 
    we recommend that you define a wildcard domain using both of them. 
    For example, to denote `example.com` as a wildcard domain, add both `\*.example.com` and `example.com` 
    to the **No Proxy** property.
