The **Host Monitoring** pane provides settings for
monitoring host VMs in your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.
In this pane, you can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to
forward logs from your BOSH-deployed VMs to a syslog endpoint as well as
configure transport of multiple metric sources.
These settings are not visible to Kubernetes cluster users.

![Host Monitoring pane](images/host-monitoring.png)

To configure host monitoring in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do the following:

* To configure Syslog for BOSH-deployed VMs, see [Syslog](#host-syslog).
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere" || current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
* To configure VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration, see [VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration](#vrealize-logs).
<% end %>
* To configure the Telegraf agent, see [Telegraf](#telegraf).

####<a id='host-syslog'></a> Syslog

1. Click **Host Monitoring**.
1. Under **Enable Syslog for PKS**, select **Yes**.
1. Under **Address**, enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Under **Port**, enter the destination syslog port.
1. Under **Transport Protocol**, select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) To enable TLS encryption during log forwarding, complete the following steps:
  1. Ensure **Enable TLS** is selected.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Logs may contain sensitive information, such as cloud provider credentials.
  Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption for log forwarding.
  </p>
  1. Under **Permitted Peer**, provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Under **TLS Certificate**, provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.
  </p>
1. (Optional) Under **Max Message Size**, enter a maximum message size for logs that are forwarded to a syslog endpoint. By default, the **Max Message Size** field is 10,000 characters.
1. Click **Save**.

####<a id='telegraf'></a> Telegraf

In **Host Monitoring**, you can configure the Telegraf agent to collect metrics from several sources
and send those metrics to a monitoring service, such as Wavefront or Datadog.

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use Telegraf for metric collection:

1. Create a configuration file for your monitoring service.
For instructions, see [Create a Configuration File](./monitor-etcd.html#toml).

1. Return to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Settings** > **Host Monitoring**.

3. Under **Enable Telegraf Outputs?**, select **Yes**.

2. Configure the Telegraf fields as follows:

    <table class="nice">
      <col width="30%">
      <col width="70%">
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>Enable node exporter on PKS API</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
            Select if you want to send node exporter metrics from the PKS API VM to your monitoring service.
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>Enable node exporter on master</strong>
           </td>
          <td>
            Select if you want to send node exporter metrics from Kubernetes master nodes to your monitoring service.
            <%= vars.product_short %> enables node exporter on the <em>localhost</em> of each master node VM.
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>Include etcd metrics</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Select if you want to send etcd server and debug metrics to your monitoring service.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>Enable node exporter on worker</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Select if you want to send node exporter metrics from Kubernetes worker nodes to your monitoring service.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Include Kubernetes Controller Manager metrics</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Select if you want to send <code>kube-controller-manager</code> metrics to your monitoring service.
          These metrics, from the core control loop, provide information about the state of each cluster.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Include Kubernetes API Server metrics</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
            Select if you want to send <code>kube-apiserver</code> metrics to your monitoring service.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>Include kubelet metrics</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
            Select if you want to send <code>kubelet</code> metrics to your monitoring service.
            This collects <code>kubelet</code> metrics for all workloads running in all Kubernetes clusters.<br>
            If you enable <strong>Include kubelet metrics</strong>, be prepared for a high volume of metrics.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. In **Setup Telegraf Outputs**, replace the default value `[[outputs.discard]]` with the contents of the configuration file
    that you created above.

1. Click **Save**.
