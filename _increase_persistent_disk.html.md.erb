If you expect the cluster workload to have a large number of pods running constantly, 
then increase the size of the Pivotal Container Service VM storage as follows:

| Number of Pods | Storage Requirement |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1,000  pods | 20 GB |
| 5,000  pods | 100 GB|
| 10,000 pods | 200 GB |
| 50,000 pods | 1,000 GB |
