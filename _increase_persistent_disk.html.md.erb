If you expect the cluster workload to have a large number of pods constantly running, then it is recommended to increase the size of the PKS instance VM persistent disk as follows:

| pods number | disk size requirement |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1,000  pods | 20 Gb |
| 5,000  pods | 100 Gb|
| 10,000 pods | 200 Gb |
| 50,000 pods | 1,000 Gb |
