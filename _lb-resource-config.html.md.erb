<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you click <strong>Apply Changes</strong> for
the first time, BOSH assigns the PKS control plane VM an IP address. BOSH uses the name you provide
in the <strong>Load Balancers</strong> column to locate your load balancer, and then connect
the load balancer to the PKS control plane VM using its new IP address.</p>
