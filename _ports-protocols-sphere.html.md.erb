This topic describes the firewall ports and protocols requirements for using <%= vars.product_full %> 
<% if current_page.data.nsxt == true %>
on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

on vSphere.  
<% end %>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Firewalls and security policies are used to filter traffic and limit access in environments with strict 
inter-network access control policies.  

Apps frequently require the ability to pass internal communication between system components on 
different networks and require one or more conduits through the environment's firewalls. 
Firewall rules are also required to enable interfacing with external systems such as with 
enterprise apps or apps and data on the public Internet.  

## <a id="secure"></a> Secure Your <%= vars.product_short %> Environment

For <%= vars.product_short %>, Pivotal recommends that you disable security policies that filter traffic between 
<% if current_page.data.nsxt == true %>
the networks supporting the system.  

To secure the environment and grant access between 
system components with <%= vars.product_short %>, use one of the following methods:

* Enable access to apps through standard Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress
controller types. This enables you to designate specific ports and protocols as a firewall conduit.  
* Enable access using the NSX-T load balancer and ingress. This enables you to configure external addresses and ports 
that are automatically mapped and resolved to internal/local addresses and ports.
<% else %>
the networks supporting the system. 

To secure the environment and grant access between system components with Enterprise PKS, 
enable access to apps 
through standard Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress controller types. This enables you to designate 
specific ports and protocols as a firewall conduit.  
<% end %>

If you are unable to implement your security policy using the methods described above, 
refer to the following table, which identifies
the flows between system components in a typical <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To control which groups access deploying and scaling 
your organization's Enterprise PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters, configure your firewall settings 
as described on the Operator â€“> PKS API server lines below.</p>
