To enable an HTTP proxy for outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Select **User Name > Settings** in the upper right.

1. Click **Proxy Settings**.

1. Under **HTTP Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTP proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:80`.

1. Under **HTTPS Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:80`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using an HTTPS connection to the proxy server is not supported. Ops Manager and BOSH HTTP and HTTPS proxy options can be only configured with an HTTP connection to the proxy.</p>

1. Under **No Proxy**, include the hosts that must bypass the proxy. This is required.
	<br><br>
	In addition to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, include the BOSH Director IP and the PKS VM IP.
	The BOSH Director IP is typically the first IP address in the deployment network CIDR,
	and the PKS VM IP is the second IP address in the deployment network CIDR. In addition, be sure to include the Ops Manager IP address in the **No Proxy** field as well.

	```
	127.0.0.1,localhost,BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP,PKS-VM-IP,OPS-MANAGER-IP
	```

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager does not allow the use of a CIDR range in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field. You must specify each individual IP address to bypass the proxy.<br><br>
	The <strong>No Proxy</strong> field does not accept wildcard domain notation, such as <code>*.docker.io</code> and <code>*.docker.com</code>. You must specify the exact IP or FQDN to bypass the proxy, such as <code>registry-1.docker.io</code>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy Ops Manager and the BOSH Director with the updated proxy settings.
