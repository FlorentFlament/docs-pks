For each job, review the **Automatic** values in the following fields:
  * **VM TYPE**: By default, the **<%= vars.control_plane_db %>** and **<%= vars.control_plane %>** jobs are set to the same **Automatic** VM type.
  If you want to adjust this value, we recommend that you select the same VM type for both jobs.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Automatic</strong> <strong>VM TYPE</strong> values match the recommended resource configuration for the <strong><%= vars.control_plane %></strong>
    and <strong><%= vars.control_plane_db %></strong> jobs.
    </p>
  * **PERSISTENT DISK TYPE**: By default, the **<%= vars.control_plane_db %>** and **<%= vars.control_plane %>** jobs are set to the same persistent disk type.
  If you want to adjust this value, you can change the persistent disk type for each of the jobs independently.
  Using the same persistent disk type for both jobs is not required.
