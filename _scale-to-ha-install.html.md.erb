(Optional) If desired, scale components of your <%= vars.product_short %> 
control plane to high availability mode as follows:
    1. To configure your control plane MySQL database for high availability, 
    increase the **INSTANCES** value for **<%= vars.control_plane_db %>** to `3`.
    1. To configure your control plane services, such as UAA and PKS CLI, for high availability, 
    increase the **INSTANCES** value for **<%= vars.control_plane %>** to `2` or more.
