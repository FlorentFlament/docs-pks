1. If you have not already done so, gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into
the Ops Manager VM, and use BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops
Manager VM. For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-7/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).

1. To identify your Kubernetes cluster deployment name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments</pre>

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias you set in [Set a BOSH Environment Alias and Log in to the BOSH Director VM](diagnostic-tools.html#alias).
  <br>
  <br>
    For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
      Each Kubernetes cluster deployment name begins with `service-instance` and includes
      a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To identify your Kubernetes cluster VM name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>

    Where:
     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your Kubernetes cluster deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f vms</pre>
    Each Kubernetes cluster VM name begins with `master` or `worker` and includes a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To SSH into your Kubernetes cluster VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh CLUSTER-VM</pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your Kubernetes cluster deployment name.
    * `CLUSTER-VM` is your Kubernetes cluster VM name. This must be either `master/VM-ID` or `worker/VM-ID`.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f ssh master/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b</pre>
