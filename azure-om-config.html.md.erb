This topic describes how to configure Ops Manager to deploy the BOSH Director for Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Amazon Web Services (Azure).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in
this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisites

To complete the procedures in this topic, you must have access to the output
from when you ran `terraform apply` to create resources for this deployment in [Deploying Ops Manager on Azure](azure-om-deploy.html).

You can view this output at any time by running `terraform output`:
<pre class="terminal">$ terraform output</pre>

You use the values in your `terraform output` to configure the BOSH Director tile.

## <a id='access-om'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have Pivotal Application Service (PAS) installed, we strongly recommend installing PKS on a separate instance of Ops Manager for security reasons.
For more information, see <a href="pas-and-pks.html">PAS and PKS Deployments with Ops Manager</a>.</p>

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager.
Use the `ops_manager_dns` value from running `terraform output`.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Ops Manager maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password that you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>SAML Identity Provider ###

1. Log in to your IdP console and download the IdP metadata XML. Optionally, if your IdP supports metadata URL, you can copy the metadata URL instead of the XML.

1. Copy the IdP metadata XML or URL to the Ops Manager **Use an Identity Provider** log in page.
     <%= image_tag("meta-om.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The same IdP metadata URL or XML is applied for the BOSH Director. If you use a separate IdP for BOSH, copy the metadata XML or URL from that IdP and enter it into the BOSH IdP Metadata text box in the Ops Manager login page.</p>

1. Enter your **Decryption passphrase**. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

1. Your Ops Manager login page appears. Enter your username and password. Click **Login**.

1. Download your SAML Service Provider metadata (SAML Relying Party metadata) by navigating to the following URLs:
    * <strong>5a.</strong> Ops Manager SAML service provider metadata: `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa/saml/metadata`
    * <strong>5b.</strong> BOSH Director SAML service provider metadata: `https://BOSH-IP-ADDRESS:8443/saml/metadata`

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To retrieve your <code>BOSH-IP-ADDRESS</code>, navigate to the <strong>Status</strong> tab of the BOSH Director tile. Record the <strong>BOSH Director</strong> IP address.</p>

1. Configure your IdP with your SAML Service Provider metadata. Import the Ops Manager SAML provider metadata from Step 5a above to your IdP.
If your IdP does not support importing, provide the values below:
    * **Single sign on** URL: `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa/saml/SSO/alias/OPS-MAN-FQDN`
    * **Audience URI** (SP Entity ID): `https://OP-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa`
    * **Name ID**: Email Address
    * SAML authentication requests are always signed.

1. Import the BOSH Director SAML provider metadata from Step 5b to your IdP. If the IdP does not support an import, provide the values below:
    * **Single sign on** URL: `https://BOSH-IP:8443/saml/SSO/alias/BOSH-IP`
    * **Audience URI** (SP Entity ID): `https://BOSH-IP:8443`
    * **Name ID**: Email Address
    * SAML authentication requests are always signed.

1. Return to the BOSH Director tile and continue with the configuration steps below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For an example of how to configure SAML integration between Ops Manager and your IdP, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/adfs-sso-configuration.html">Configuring Active Directory Federation Services as an Identity Provider</a> topic.</p>

### <a id='ldap'></a> LDAP Server

* For **Server URL**, enter the URL that point your LDAP server. With
multiple LDAP servers, separate their URLs with spaces. Each URL must include
one of the following protocols:
    * `ldap://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses an unencrypted
connection.
    * `ldaps://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses SSL for an encrypted connection and requires that the LDAP server holds a trusted certificate or that you import a trusted certificate to the JVM truststore.
      <%= image_tag("images/ldap-serv.png") %>

* For **LDAP Username** and **LDAP Password**, enter the LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) and the
password for binding to the LDAP Server. Example DN: `cn=administrator,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
     <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you provide LDAP credentials that grant read-only permissions on the LDAP Search Base and the LDAP Group Search Base. In addition to this, if the bind user belongs to a different search base, you must use the full DN.</p>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>Pivotal recommends against reusing LDAP service accounts across environments. LDAP service accounts should not be subject to manual lockouts, such as lockouts that result from users utilizing the same account. Also, LDAP service accounts should not be subject to automated deletions, since disruption to these service accounts could prevent user logins.
    </p>
  
* For **User Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree from
which any LDAP User search begins. The typical LDAP Search Base matches your
domain name.
<br><br>
For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following LDAP User Search Base: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`

* For **User Search Filter**, enter a string that defines LDAP User search
criteria. These search criteria allow LDAP to perform more effective and
efficient searches. For example, the standard LDAP search filter `cn=Smith`
returns all objects with a common name equal to `Smith`.
<br><br>
In the LDAP search filter string that you use to configure PAS, use `{0}`
instead of the username. For example, use `cn={0}` to return
all LDAP objects with the same common name as the username.
<br><br>
In addition to `cn`, other attributes commonly searched for and returned are
`mail`, `uid` and, in the case of Active Directory, `sAMAccountName`.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For instructions for testing and troubleshooting your LDAP search filters, see [Configuring LDAP Integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Configuring-LDAP-Integration-with-Pivotal-Cloud-Foundry) in the Pivotal Support Knowledge Base.</p>

* For **Group Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree
from which the LDAP Group search begins.
<br><br>
For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following
LDAP Group Search Base: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`

* For **Group Search Filter**, enter a string that defines LDAP Group search
criteria. The standard value is `member={0}`.

* For **Email Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP directory
that corresponds to the email address in each user record, for example `mail`.

* For **LDAP RBAC Admin Group Name**, enter the DN of the LDAP group you want to have admin permissions in Ops Manager.

* From the dropdown menu, select how the UAA handles LDAP server referrals out
to other external user stores. The UAA can: 
    * **Automatically follow any referrals**.
    * **Ignore referrals and return partial result**. 
    * **Throw exception for each referral and abort.**

* For **Server SSL Cert**, paste in the root certificate from your CA
certificate or your self-signed certificate.

* Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.

* If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).

* Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

* Select **Provision an admin client in the BOSH UAA**. You can use this to enable BOSH automation with scripts and tooling. For more information, see [Provision Admin Client](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/opsmanager-create-bosh-client.html#saml) in _Creating UAA Clients for BOSH Director_.

* Click **Setup Authentication**.

* Return to the **BOSH Director** tile, and continue with the configuration steps below.
