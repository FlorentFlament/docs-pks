This topic describes how to back up and restore Ops Manager for use with <%= vars.product_full %>.

## Planning

To backup and restore Ops Manager, you must manually export the Ops Manager configuration and then import it to a new Ops Manager instance. 

Ops Manager exports an encrypted archive of your current installation configuration. The encryption password for the backup configuration is set during the initial installation of Ops Manager. You must know this password to be able to restore the configuration.

Only the configuration settings that have been backed up can be restored. Any changes made to the Ops Manager configuration after a backup will not be preserved until the next backup is taken.

## Backup Procedure

Complete the following steps to back up Ops Manager.

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. Click the user name in the top right corner.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.
