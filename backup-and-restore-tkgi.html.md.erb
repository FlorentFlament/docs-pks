title: Backing Up and Restoring TKGI Clusters
owner: TKGI

This section describes how to back up and restore <%= vars.product_full %> nodes. <%= vars.product_short %> uses BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) software to back up and restore the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane and clusters. For more information about BBR, see [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html).

## Components

BBR orchestrates triggering the backup or restore process on the BOSH deployment, and transfers the backup artifacts to and from the BOSH deployment.

## Scenarios and Considerations

Test Scenario 						| Expected Result
------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
| Take backup of TKGI using BBR. Delete cluster VMs: control plane and worker nodes. Delete disks and references. Restore cluster nodes using BBR. Delete old worker nodes using kubectl. Restart kubelet. | If app is deployed before cluster backup, the VIP of the load balancer for the app changes. To revoer without app redeploymewnt, create service using static IP.
| Take backup of TKGI using BBR. Delete cluster VMs: control plane and worker nodes. Delete disks and references. Restore cluster nodes using BBR. Delete old worker nodes using kubectl. Restart kubelet. | If app is deployed after cluster backup, the app is no longer available and the NSX-T objects created for the app are automatically deleted.
