This section describes how to back up and restore Kubernetes workloads deployed to TKGI clusters using Valero and Restic.

## About Valero and Restic

[Valero](https://velero.io/) is an open source tool to safely backup and restore, perform disaster recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) is an open-source backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. 

Velero is the only open source product to provide backup and recovery capabilities of Kubernetes workloads. Using Valero provides a consistent solution for backup and recovery across the Tanzu portfolio of products. Restic is used as a [companion tool](https://velero.io/docs/v1.4/restic/) with Valero to provide platform independent volume snapshots. Together Vaero and Restic support backup and recovery all types of Kubernetes workloads deployed to Tanzu clusters.

## Cluster Requirements

To use the Valero-Restic solution for Kubernetes workload backup and recovery with TKGI, you must configure each cluster as follows:

1. Enable the `Allow Privileged` option in your plan configuration so that restic is able to mount the hostpath.
1. Change the hostPath from `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to `/var/vcap/data/kubelet/pods`.
