This section describes how to back up and restore the <%= vars.product_full %> control plane and <%= vars.product_short %> clusters.
<%= vars.product_short %> uses the BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) framework to back up and restore the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane and clusters. For more information, see [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html).
