title: Backing up and Restoring Enterprise PKS
owner: PKS

This section describes how to back up and restore the <%= vars.product_full %> control plane and <%= vars.product_short %> clusters.
<%= vars.product_short %> uses the Cloud Foundry [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html) framework to back up and restore the PKS control plane and clusters.

BBR backs up the following PKS control plane components:

* UAA MySQL database
* PKS API MySQL database

BBR backs up the following cluster components:

* etcd database

BBR orchestrates triggering the backup or restore process on the BOSH deployment,
and transfers the backup artifacts to and from the BOSH deployment.

For more information about installing and using BBR, see the following topics:

* [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html)
* [Backing up <%= vars.product_short %>](bbr-backup.html)  
* [Restore the BOSH Director](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-director)  
* [Restore the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-control-plane)  
* [Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-clusters) 

For information about troubleshooting BBR, see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
