This section describes how to back up and restore the <%= vars.product_full %> control plane and <%= vars.product_short %> clusters.
<%= vars.product_short %> uses the Cloud Foundry [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html) framework to back up and restore the <%= vars.product_short %> control plane and clusters.

BBR backs up the following <%= vars.product_short %> control plane components:

* UAA MySQL database
* PKS API MySQL database

BBR backs up the following cluster components:

* etcd database

BBR orchestrates triggering the backup or restore process on the BOSH deployment,
and transfers the backup artifacts to and from the BOSH deployment.

For more information about installing and using BBR, see the following topics:
