title: Backing up the PKS BOSH Director and Control Plane
owner: PKS
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to back up the  <%= vars.product_full %> BOSH Director and Control Plane.

The <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director and Control Plane includes custom backup and restore scripts which encapsulate the correct procedure
for backing up and restoring the Director and Control Plane.

BBR orchestrates running the backup and restore scripts and transferring the generated backup artifacts to and from a backup directory.
If configured correctly, BBR can use TLS to communicate securely with backup targets.

To perform a restore of the BOSH Director, see [Restoring the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director](bbr-restore-director.html).
To perform a restore of the PKS Control Plane, see [Restoring the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](bbr-restore-control-plane.html).

To view the BBR release notes, see the Cloud Foundry documentation, [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html).

## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

BBR can backup the following components:

  - BOSH Director
  - <%= vars.product_short %> control plane UAA MySQL database
  - <%= vars.product_short %> control plane PKS API MySQL database

## <a id='unsupported'></a> Unsupported Components

BBR backups of the following components have not been validated:

  - Harbor tile
  - vSphere with NSX-t Objects

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Verify that the installed version of BBR is compatible with this <%= vars.product_short %> release.
For minimum version information, see the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html).

If you want to use the result of the backup to restore to a destination environment, verify that
the current environment and the destination environment are compatible.

You also need to get the BBR SSH Credentials and IP address for the BOSH Director:

* [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds)
* [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address)
* [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert)
* [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds)

### <a id='bbr-ssh-creds'></a> Download the BBR SSH Credentials

There are two ways to retrieve BOSH Director credentials:

* [Ops Manager Installation Dashboard](#bbr-ssh-creds-via-ui)
* [Ops Manager API](#bbr-ssh-creds-via-api)

#### <a id='bbr-ssh-creds-via-ui'></a> Ops Manager Installation Dashboard

To retrieve your BOSH Director credentials using the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the BOSH Director tile.
1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Locate **Bbr Ssh Credentials**.
  1. Click Link to Credentials next to it.
  1. Copy the value of the `private_key_pem` field.
  1. run the following command to reformat the copied value, and save it in the current directory to a file named `private-key-file`:

    ```
    printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY</code></td>
        <td>This is the text of your private key.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PRIVATE-KEY-FILE</code></td>
        <td>This is the path to the private key file you are creating.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ printf --  "-----begin rsa private key----- fake key contents ----end rsa private key-----" > bbr_key.pem
    </re>

#### <a id='bbr-ssh-creds-via-api'></a> Ops Manager API

To retrieve your BOSH Director credentials using the Ops Manager API, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api)
1. Retrieve the **Director Credentials** by running the following command:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr_ssh_credentials" \
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>OPS-MAN-FQDN</code></td>
        <td>This is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN</code></td>
        <td>This is your UAA access token.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. Copy the value of the `private_key_pem` field.
1. Run the following command to reformat the copied value, and save it in the current directory
to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE`:

    ```
    printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY</code></td>
        <td>This is the text of your private key.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PRIVATE-KEY-FILE</code></td>
        <td>This is the path to the private key file you are creating.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ printf --  "-----begin rsa private key----- fake key contents ----end rsa private key-----" > bbr_key.pem
    </re>

### <a id='retrieve-bosh-address'></a> Retrieve BOSH Director Address
1. If you are not using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, install the latest [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install) on your jumpbox.
1. From the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager, select **BOSH Director > Status** and record the IP address listed for the Director.
You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

1. From the command line, log into the BOSH Director, using the IP address that you recorded above,
by running the following command:

    <pre>
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE log-in
    </pre>

    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP</code></td>
        <td>This is the BOSH Director IP address recorded above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE</code></td>
        <td>This is the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as outlined in [Download the Root CA Certificate](bbr-backup-control-plane.html#root-ca-cert).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. When prompted for **Email ()**, specify `director`.
1. When prompted for **Password ()**, enter the **Director Credentials** that you obtained in
   [Retrieve BOSH Director Credentials](#retrieve-credentials).

    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate log-in
    Email (): director
    Password (): *******************
    Successfully authenticated with UAA
    Succeeded
    </pre>

### <a id='root-ca-cert'></a> Download the Root CA Certificate
To download
the root CA certificate for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment, perform the following steps:

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, in the top right corner, click your username.
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced**.
1. Click **Download Root CA Cert**.

### <a id='bosh-cli-creds'></a> Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.
1. In the BOSH Director tile, click the **Credentials** tab.
1. Navigate to **Bosh Command line Credentials** and click **Link to Credential**.
1. Copy the credential value.

## <a id='connect-to-jumpbox'></a> Step 1: Connect to Your Jumpbox

You can establish a connection to your jumpbox in one of the following ways.

* [Connect with SSH](#ssh)
* [Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY](#bosh-all-proxy)

For general information about the jumpbox, see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).

### <a id='ssh'></a> Connect with SSH

SSH into your jumpbox. If you connect to your jumpbox with SSH, you must run the BBR commands in
the following sections from within your jumpbox.

### <a id='bosh-all-proxy'></a> Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY

Set and use `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`. Using `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` opens an SSH tunnel with SOCKS5 to the
jumpbox. This tunnel enables you to forward requests to the BOSH Director through the jumpbox from
your local machine.

Use one of the following methods to create the tunnel:

* **Tunnel created by BOSH CLI**: To provide the BOSH CLI with the SSH credentials it needs to
create the tunnel, run the following command:

    ```
    export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=ssh+socks5://jumpbox@jumpbox-ip:12345?private_key=jumpbox.key
    ```

* **Tunnel established separately**:

  1. To establish the tunnel and make it available on a local port, run the following command:

    ```
    ssh -4 -D 12345 -fNC jumpbox@jumpbox-ip -i jumpbox.key
    ```

  1. To provide the BOSH CLI with access to the tunnel through use of the `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`
  environment variable, run the following command:

    ```
    export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:12345
    ```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> can result in longer
backup and restore times due to network performance degradation. Because all operations must pass
through the proxy, moving backup artifacts can be significantly slower.</p>

## <a id='export-opsman-settings'></a> Step 2: Export Installation Settings

Pivotal recommends that you back up your Ops Manager installation settings by exporting frequently.

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind the following:

* This option is only available after you have deployed at least once.

* Always export your installation settings before following the steps in the [Recreate the BOSH Director VM](bbr-restore-director.html#recreate-vms) section of the *Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>* topic.

* Exporting your installation settings only backs up the settings you configured in Ops Manager. It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

* Your Ops Manager settings are encrypted. Make sure you keep track of your Decryption Passphrase because this is needed to restore the Ops Manager settings.

There are two ways to export Ops Manager installation settings:

* [Use the Ops Manager UI](#export-via-ui)
* [Use the Ops Manager API](#export-via-api)

#### <a id='export-via-ui'></a> Use The Ops Manager UI

1. From the **Installation Dashboard** in the Ops Manager interface, click your username at the top right navigation.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.
1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.

#### <a id='export-via-api'></a> Use The Ops Manager API
If you want to automate the back up process, you can use the Ops Manager API to export your installation settings.

  1. To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager API, run the following command:

  ```
  curl https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
  ```
  Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
      <th>Instructions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>OPS-MAN-FQDN</code></td>
      <td>This is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN</code></td>
      <td>This is your UAA access token. For more information, see Access the API.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

## <a id='back-up-director'></a> Step 3: Back up the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director

1. Run the BBR pre-backup check to confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and has the correct BBR scripts:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP</code></td>
        <td>This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can retrieve as show in [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PRIVATE-KEY-FILE</code></td>
        <td>This is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bbr director \
    --host 10.0.0.5 \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private-key.pem
    pre-backup-check
    </pre>

1. If the pre-backup check command fails, perform the following actions:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Make any correction suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again. For example,
     the connection to the BOSH Director failed.

1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up the
PKS BOSH Director:

    ```
    bbr director \
    --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    backup
    ```

    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP</code></td>
        <td>This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can retrieve as show in [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PRIVATE-KEY-FILE</code></td>
        <td>This is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bbr director \
    --host 10.0.0.5 \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private-key.pem
    backup
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete.
    You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even
    if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you can
    run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session instead.</p>

1. If the command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Manage Your Backup Artifact](#good-practices) below.

1. If the backup command fails, perform the following actions:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recover-from-failing-command).

## <a id='locate-deploy-name'></a> Step 4: Locate the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Name

Locate and record your <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name as follows:

1. Open an SSH connection to either your jumpbox, as described in the previous section, or the Ops Manager VM.
For instructions on how to SSH into the Ops Manager VM, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).
1. On the command line, run the following command to retrieve your <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name.

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS deployments | grep pivotal-container-service
    ```

    Where `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` includes the full value that you copied from the BOSH Director tile in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials
](#bosh-cli-creds).
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh deployments | grep pivotal-container-service

    pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041           backup-and-restore-sdk/1.8.0    bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent/250.25
    service-instance_4ffeb5b5-5182-4faa-9d92-696d97cc9ae1    bosh-dns/1.10.0                 bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent/250.25
    pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041
    </pre>

1. In the output, look for the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that begins with
  `pivotal-container-service` and includes a unique identifier.
   In the example output above, the BOSH deployment name is `pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041`.

## <a id='back-up-control-plane'></a> Step 5: Back up the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane

1. Run the BBR pre-backup check to confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a
deployment that can be backed up:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-TARGET</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;ENVIRONMENT</code>.
        You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run <code>bbr</code> commands.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>DEPLOYMENT-NAME</code></td>
        <td>Use the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that you located in the [Locate and Record the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Names](#locate-deploy-name) section above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT</code></td>
        <td>Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
    pre-backup-check</pre>

1. If the pre-backup check command fails, perform the following actions:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Make any correction suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again. For example,
    the deployment that you selected might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection
    to the BOSH Director failed.

1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up the
PKS control plane:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup [--with-manifest] [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table. These are the same
    values as shown in the previous table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>

          <td>This allows you to specify a path for the backup artifact.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The `--with-manifest` flag is necessary in order to redeploy your PKS Control Plane in the case of its loss.</p>

      For example:

## <a id="recover-from-failing-command"></a> Recover from a Failing Command

If the backup fails, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you set all the parameters in the backup command.
1. Ensure the BOSH Director credentials are valid.
1. Ensure the deployment that you specify in the BBR command exists.
1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.
1. Consult [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
1. If you see the error message `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
   run the appropriate cleanup command. See [Clean up After a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.
1. If the backup artifact is corrupted, discard the failing artifacts and run the backup again.

## <a id='cancel-backup'></a> Cancel a Backup

Backups can take a long time.
If you need to cancel a backup, for example if you realize that the backup is going to fail or that
your developers need to push an app in a hurry, follow these steps:

1. Terminate the BBR process by pressing Ctrl-C and typing `yes` to confirm.
1. Because stopping a backup can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent additional
backups, follow the procedures in [Clean up After a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id="manual-clean"></a> Clean up After a Failed Backup

If your backup process fails, it might leave the BBR backup directory on the instance, causing any
subsequent attempts to backup to fail.
In addition, BBR might not have run the post-backup scripts, leaving the instance in a locked state.

  * If the PKS BOSH Director backup failed, run the following command to use the BBR cleanup script to
    clean up:

      ```
      bbr director \
      --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
      --username bbr \
      --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
      backup-cleanup
      ```

      Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
          <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP</code></td>
          <td>This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can retrieve as show in [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>PRIVATE-KEY-FILE</code></td>
          <td>This is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      For example:

      <pre class="terminal">
      $ bbr director \
      --host 10.0.0.5 \
      --username bbr \
      --private-key-path private-key.pem
      backup-cleanup
      </pre>

  * If the PKS control plane backup failed, run the following command to use the BBR cleanup script to
    clean up:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \
    backup-cleanup
    ```

    Replace the placeholder text using the information in the following table. These are the same
    values as shown in the previous table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="32%">Placeholder Text</th>
        <th>Instructions</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-TARGET</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;ENVIRONMENT</code>.
        You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run <code>bbr</code> commands.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT</code></td>
        <td>In your BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>DEPLOYMENT-NAME</code></td>
        <td>Use the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that you located in the [Locate and Record the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Names](#locate-deploy-name) section above.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT</code></td>
        <td>Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in the [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
    backup-cleanup
    </pre>

## <a id="good-practices"></a> Manage Your Backup Artifact

Keep your backup artifacts safe by following these steps:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your storage space. BBR stores each backup in a subdirectory named `DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP` and `DIRECTOR-IP-TIMESTAMP`,
for the Control Plane and BOSH Director backups respectively, within the current working directory.
The backup created by BBR consists of a directory with the backup artifacts and metadata files.

1. Compress and encrypt the backup artifacts when storing them.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup and store them in multiple locations. This minimizes the
risk of losing your backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Each time you redeploy <%= vars.product_short %>, test your backup artifact by following the procedures in:
  * [Back up the <%- vars.product_short %> BOSH Director](#back-up-director).
  * [Back up the <%- vars.product_short %> Control Plane](#back-up-control-plane).
