<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to perform an in-place restore of
your single master cluster deployed by <%= vars.product_full %>. By performing this restore, you can restore the single master cluster
to its previous state.

To perform a back up of a single master cluster with BBR, see the instructions in
[Backing up the Single Master Cluster](bbr-backup-cluster.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> When you restore the single master cluster, etcd
is stopped in the API server. During this process, only currently deployed clusters function, and
you cannot create new workloads.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> BBR only backs up and restores the cluster etcd data. This includes the cluster-deployed workloads. Persistent volumes and other IaaS resources, such as load balancers of workloads, are not backed up and restored. Backup and restore for clusters deployed on vSphere with NSX-T is not yet supported.</p>

## <a id="compatibility"></a> Compatibility of Restore

This section describes the restrictions on a backup artifact for it to be restorable to another
environment.
This section is for guidance only.
Pivotal highly recommends that operators validate their backups by using the backup artifacts in a
restore.

The restrictions for a backup artifact to be restorable are the following:

* **Topology**: BBR requires the BOSH topology of a deployment to be the same in the restore
environment as it was in the backup environment.
* **Naming of instance groups and jobs**: For any deployment that implements the backup and restore
scripts, the instance groups and jobs must have the same names.
* **Number of instance groups and jobs**: For instance groups and jobs that have backup and restore
scripts, the same number of instances must exist.
* **Limited validation**: BBR stores the backed up data into the corresponding instance groups and
jobs in the restored environment, but cannot validate the restore beyond in other ways. For
example, if the MySQL encryption key is different in the restore environment, the BBR restore might
succeed but the restored MySQL database would be unusable.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A change in VM size or underlying hardware should not affect 
the ability of BBR to restore data, as long as adequate storage space to restore the data
exists.</p>

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before using the result of the backup to restore to a destination environment, verify that the
current environment and the destination environment are compatible. For more information, see
[Compatibility of Restore](bbr-restore-cluster.html#compatibility) in 
_Restoring the Single Master Cluster_.

Before you begin restoring your <%= vars.product_short %> cluster deployment, perform the following steps:

* [Download the Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate)
* [Record Your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH Deployment Name](#record-name)

### <a id='download-certificate'></a> Download the Root CA Certificate

Download the root certificate authority (CA) certificate for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment by following the
steps below.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click your username in the top right corner.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Advanced**.

1. Click **Download Root CA Cert**.

### <a id='record-name'></a> Record Your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH Deployment Name

Locate and record your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH deployment name by following the steps below.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. To find the cluster ID associated with the cluster you want to back up, run the following
command:

    ```
    pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster. From the output of this command, record the
    value of **UUID**.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. Navigate to **Bosh Commandline Credentials** and click **Link to Credential**.

1. Copy the credential value.

1. SSH into your jumpbox. For more information about the jumpbox, see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html#jumpbox-setup).

1. To retrieve your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH deployment name, run the following command:

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS deployments | grep UUID
    ```
    Where:
	 * `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` is the credential value that you copied in the previous step.
	 * `UUID` is the cluster UUID that you recorded in
    [Record Your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH Deployment Name](#record-name).
    <br><br>
    Your <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH deployment name begins with `service-instance` and includes a unique
    identifier.

## <a id="recreate-vms"></a> Step 1: Recreate VMs

Before restoring the <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster, you must create the virtual machines (VMs) that constitute the
deployment.

In a disaster recovery scenario, you can re-create the deployment with your <%= vars.product_short %> cluster manifest.
If you used the `--with-manifest` flag when you ran the BBR backup command, your backup artifact
includes a copy of your manifest.

## <a id="artifacts-jumpbox"></a> Step 2: Transfer Artifacts to Jumpbox

Copy your BBR backup artifact from your safe storage location to the jumpbox. You can use any copy
process that suits your needs. If your backup artifact is encrypted, you must decrypt it.

For example, run the following command to use the Secure copy protocol (SCP) to copy the backup
artifact to your jumpbox:

```
scp LOCAL-PATH-TO-BACKUP-ARTIFACT JUMPBOX-USER/JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
```
Where:

* `LOCAL-PATH-TO-BACKUP-ARTIFACT` is the local path to your backup artifact.
* `JUMPBOX-USER` is your jumpbox username.
* `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address of your jumpbox.

## <a id='restore'></a> Step 3: Restore the Cluster

Perform the steps below to restore a <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The BBR restore command can take a long time to complete.
You can run it independently of an SSH session so that the process can continue running even if
your connection to the jumpbox fails. The example command below uses <code>nohup</code>, but you
can instead run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

1. Move the <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster backup artifact to a folder from which you will run the BBR restore process.

1. SSH into your jumpbox. For more information about the jumpbox, see [Install BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html#jumpbox-setup).

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    restore \
    --artifact-path PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-BACKUP
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
      **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    * `BOSH-TARGET`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
      **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`.
      You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run `bbr`
      commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
      **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT`.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: Use the <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH deployment name that you recorded in the
      [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in the
      [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * `PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-BACKUP`: Use the path to to your deployment backup.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
    restore \
    --artifact-path deployment-backup
    </pre>

1. If the restore command fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
      see [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recover).

## <a id="recover"></a> Recover from a Failing Command

If your backup fails, follow these steps below:

1. Ensure that all the parameters in the command are set.

1. Ensure that the BOSH Director credentials are valid.

1. Ensure the specified BOSH deployment exists.

1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.

1. Consult [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).

1. If you see the error message `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
run the appropriate cleanup command. See [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id='cancel-restore'></a>Cancel a Restore

If you must cancel a backup, follow the steps below:

1. Terminate the BBR process by entering `Ctrl-C`, then entering `yes` to confirm.

1. Because stopping a backup can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent future backups,
follow the procedures in [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id="manual-clean"></a>Clean Up after a Failed Restore

If you stop the restore process or the restore process fails, then the process may leave the BBR
restore folder on the instance. As a result, any subsequent attempts to restore may also fail.
In addition, if the interruption prevents BBR from running the post-restore scripts, the instance
may be left in a locked state.

If you stop the backup process or the process fails, run the following command:

```
BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
bbr deployment \
--target BOSH-TARGET \
--username BOSH-CLIENT \
--deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \ 
--ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \ 
restore-cleanup
```

Replace the placeholder text as follows:

* `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
  **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
* `BOSH-TARGET`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
  **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`. You must
  be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run `bbr` commands.
* `BOSH-CLIENT`: In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to
  **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials**. Record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT`.
* `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: Use the <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster BOSH deployment name that you recorded in the
  [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
* `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in the
  [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
bbr deployment \
--target bosh.example.com \
--username admin \
--deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
--ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
restore-cleanup
</pre>

If the cleanup script fails, consult the following table to match the exit codes to an error
message.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Error</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Success</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>General failure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>8</td>
    <td>The post-restore unlock failed. Your deployment may be in a bad state and require
      attention.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>The cleanup failed. This is a non-fatal error indicating that the utility has been unable to clean up open BOSH SSH connections to the deployment VMs. Manual cleanup may be required to clear any hanging BOSH users and connections.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
