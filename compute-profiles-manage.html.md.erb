title: Creating and Managing Compute Profiles with the CLI
owner: TKGI
---

This topic describes how <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) administrators on vSphere with NSX-T can create and delete compute profiles for Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.
It also lists verified use cases for compute profiles on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

For more information on how to use compute profiles, see [Using Compute Profiles](./compute-profiles-use.html).

## <a id="vs-plans"></a> Compute Profiles vs. Plans

As with plans defined in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **Plans** panes,
compute profiles let <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> admins define cluster resource choices for developers using Kubernetes.

Compute profiles offer more granular control over cluster topology and node sizing than plans do.
For example, compute profiles can define heterogenous clusters with different
CPU, memory, ephemeral disk, or persistent disk settings for master nodes and worker nodes.

You can also apply a compute profile to specific clusters, overriding the default settings defined by their plan and possibly avoiding the need to create new plans.

You use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile to manage plans
and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to manage compute profiles.

## <a id="create"></a> Create a Compute Profile

To create a compute profile in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, you:

1. Define a compute profile in a JSON configuration file, following the [Compute Profile Format](#format) below.

1. Use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to define the compute profile within <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, as described in [The create-compute-profile Command](#run-create), below.

### <a id="format"></a> Compute Profile Format

To create a compute profile, you must first define it as a JSON file that specifies network parameters, listed in [Compute Profile Parameters](#params) below.

Here is an example compute profile that includes all available parameters.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This example compute profile is for illustration purposes only. It is not intended to be used as a template for compute profile definition.</p>

```
{
 "name": "my-compute-profile",
 "description": "my compute profile description",
 "parameters": {
  "AZs" : [
   {
     "name": "az-name",
     "cloud_properties": {}
   }
 ],
 "cluster_customization": {
   "control_plane": 
     {
       "vm_resources": {
         "cpu" : 4,
         "memory" : 4098,
         "disk" : 8196
       },
       "azs": ["az-1", "az-2"],
       "instances" : 2,
     "resource_label": "small"
     },
   "nodes": [
     {
       "vm_resources": {
         "cpu" : 2,
         "memory" : 2048,
         "disk" : 8196
       },
       "azs": ["az-1", "az-2"],
       "resource_label": "node1",
       "Instances" : 2
     },
{
       "vm_resources": {
         "cpu" : 2,
         "memory" : 2048,
         "disk" : 8196
       },
       "azs": ["az-1", "az-2"],
       "resource_label": "node2",
       "Instances" : 2
     }
   ]
 }
} 
}

```

### <a id="params"></a> Compute Profile Parameters

The compute profile JSON can include the following top-level parameters:

Parameter 					| Type 		| Description 
----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
| `name` 					| String 	| Name of the compute profile. 
| `description` 			| String 	| Description of the compute profile. 
| `parameters` 				| Map 		| One or more name-value pairs. 
| `AZs` 				| Map 	| Pairs defining AZ name with `cloud_properties` settings.
| `cluster_customization`		| Map 	| `vm_resources` settings for Kubernetes cluster nodes. 
| `control_plane`		| JSON 	| Settings for Kubernetes control plane node.
| `nodes`		| Map 	| `vm_resources` settings for worker nodes.
| `vm_resources`		| Map 	| Settings for `cpu`, `memory`, and `disk`.
| `azs` 			| List 	| AZs where node instances run`. 
| `instances` 			| Integer 	| Number of node instances. 

The compute profile JSON accepts the following parameters for `vm_resources`:

Parameter 							| Type 		| Description 
------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
| `cpu` 			| Integer 	| CPU count for node instance. 
| `memory` 	| Integer 	| RAM for node instance, in MB. 
| `disk` 				| Integer 	| Total disk (persistent plus ephemeral) for node instance, in MB.

### <a id="run-create"></a> The create-compute-profile Command

After a compute profile is defined in a JSON file as described in [Compute Profile Format](#format),
an <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrator can create the compute profile by running the following <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI command:

```
tkgi create-compute-profile PATH-TO-YOUR-COMPUTE-PROFILE-CONFIGURATION
``` 
Where `PATH-TO-YOUR-COMPUTE-PROFILE-CONFIGURATION` is the path to the JSON file
you created when defining the compute profile.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ tkgi create-compute-profile large-workers.json

Compute profile large-workers successfully created
</pre>

Only cluster administrators, `pks.clusters.admin`, can create compute profiles.
If a cluster manager `pks.clusters.manage` or read-only admin `pks.clusters.admin-read-only` attempts to create a compute profile, the following error occurs:

```
You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrator.
```

After an administrator creates a compute profile, cluster managers can create clusters with it or assign it to existing clusters.
For more information, see the [Using Compute Profiles](./compute-profiles-use.html) topic.

## <a id="manage"></a> Manage Compute Profiles

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrators can delete compute profiles.
Administrators can also perform the same operations that cluster managers use to list compute profiles and manage how clusters use them.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> These commands do not work for compute profiles created using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 or earlier.</p>


### <a id="view"></a> View a Compute Profile

To view details about a compute profile, run the following command:

```
tkgi compute-profile COMPUTE-PROFILE-NAME
```

Where `COMPUTE-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the compute profile you want to delete.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ tkgi compute-profile Basic-compute-profile

	Name:                     Basic-compute-profile
	Owner:                    Alana
	Created Date              Tue, 15 Jul 2020 16:28:15 PST
	Description:              compute profile for customer A
	â€¦.
	<KEY> :                   <VALUE>
</pre>

$ pks compute-profile <compute profile name> 


### <a id="delete"></a> Delete a Compute Profile

To delete a compute profile, run the following command:

```
tkgi delete-compute-profile COMPUTE-PROFILE-NAME
```

Where `COMPUTE-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the compute profile you want to delete.

Limitations:

- You cannot delete a compute profile that is in use.
The profile must be disassociated from all clusters, or all associated clusters must be deleted.

- Only cluster administrators, `pks.clusters.admin`, can delete compute profiles.
If a cluster manager `pks.clusters.manage` or read-only admin `pks.clusters.admin-read-only` attempts to delete a compute profile, the following error occurs:

	```
	You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrator.
	```

### <a id="user-ops"></a> Cluster Manager Operations

The following sections link to operations that both <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrators and cluster managers can perform on compute profiles,
documented in the [Using Compute Profiles (NSX-T Only)](compute-profiles-use.html) topic.

* [List Compute Profiles](compute-profiles-use.html#list-profiles) 
* [Create a Cluster with a Compute Profile](compute-profiles-use.html#create)
* [Assign a Compute Profile to an Existing Cluster](compute-profiles-use.html#assign)
  - This operation can assign a compute profile to a cluster that does not have one, or change a cluster's existing profile.
  - You cannot change a cluster's compute profile to move its nodes to different Availability Zones.

## <a id='use-cases'></a> Compute Profile Use Cases

Compute profiles let you customize NSX-T configuration parameters at the time of cluster creation. Use cases for compute profiles include:
