In Kubernetes, an ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster. The cluster must have an ingress controller running. For more information, see [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

To configure an ingress controller for PKS on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), see [How to set up an Ingress Controller for a PKS cluster](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/how-to-set-up-an-ingress-controller-for-a-pks-cluster) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.
