The following sections describe how to troubleshoot failures to deploy of the <%= vars.product_full %> Management Console appliance and of <%= vars.product_short %> instances from the management console.

## <a id='ova-fails'></a> Deployment of the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Appliance Fails

If the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance fails to deploy from the OVA template, attempt the following steps.

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM as `root` user.
<br>Use the password that you specified when you  deployed the OVA.
1. Run the following command to obtain the server logs.
<br>`journalctl -u pks-mgmt-server > server.log`
1. If the logs do not provide the solution, delete the appliance VM from vCenter Server and attempt to deploy it again.

## <a id='pks-nsxt-fails'></a>Deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T Data Center Fails

If <%= vars.product_short %> fails to deploy to a vSphere environment with NSX-T Data Center, you might need to remove the NSX-T registration in order to try the installation again. You do this by accessing the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM and running a script that removes the NSX-T registration and cleans up.

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM as `root` user.
<br>Use the password that you specified when you  deployed the OVA.
1. Navigate to the directory `/opt/vmware/scripts/nsx`.
1. Run the following command to clean up the NSX-T objects created during the installation process.<pre>python3 clean_up.py <i>nsx-manager-ip</i> <i>nsx-username</i> <i>nsx-password</i></pre>
1. Attempt to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> again.
