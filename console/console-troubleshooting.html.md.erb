The following sections describe how to troubleshoot failures to deploy of the VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance and of <%= vars.product_short %> instances from the management console.

## <a id='ova-fails'></a> Deployment of the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Appliance Fails

If the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance fails to deploy from the OVA template, attempt the following steps.

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM as `root` user.
<br>Use the password that you specified when you  deployed the OVA.
1. Run the following command to obtain the server logs.
<br>`journalctl -u pks-mgmt-server > server.log`
1. If the logs do not provide the solution, delete the appliance VM from vCenter Server and attempt to deploy it again.

## <a id='pks-nsxt-fails'></a>Deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T Data Center Fails

If <%= vars.product_short %> fails to deploy to a vSphere environment with NSX-T Data Center, you might need to remove the NSX-T Data Center registration in order to try the installation again. You do this by accessing the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM and running a script that removes the NSX-T Data Center registration and cleans up.

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM as `root` user.
<br>Use the password that you specified when you  deployed the OVA.
1. Navigate to the directory `/opt/vmware/scripts/nsx`.
1. Run the following command to clean up the NSX-T Data Center objects created during the installation process.<pre>python3 clean_up.py <i>nsx-manager-ip</i> <i>nsx-username</i> <i>nsx-password</i></pre>
1. Attempt to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> again.

## <a id='log-insight'></a>Obtain the vRealize Log Insight Agent ID for <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console 

If you enabled integration with VMware vRealize Log Insight, <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console generates a unique vRealize Log Insight agent ID for the appliance. You must provide this agent ID to vRealize Log Insight so that it can pull the appropriate logs from the appliance.

You obtain the vRealize Log Insight agent ID as follows:

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM as `root` user.
1. Run the following command to obtain the ID.

   ```
   grep LOGINSIGHT_ID /etc/vmware/environment | cut -d= -f2
   ```   

   The resulting ID will be similar to `59debec7-daba-4770-9d21-226ffd743843`.
1. Log in to the vRealize Log Insight Web user interface as administrator and add the agent ID to your list of agents.
