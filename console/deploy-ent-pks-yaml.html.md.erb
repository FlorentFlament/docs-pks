<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

If you have an existing YAML configuration file from a previous deployment of <%= vars.product_full %>, you can use the VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to deploy a new <%= vars.product_short %> instance from that file.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can only use the management console to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> from a YAML file if that YAML file was generated by <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console version 1.5.0 or later. YAML files from previous beta releases of the management console are incompatible with this release.</p>

- For information about how to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> by using the configuration wizard, see [Deploy <%= vars.product_short %> by Using the Configuration Wizard](deploy-ent-pks-wizard.html).
- For information about how to upgrade an existing deployment, see [Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console](upgrade-console.html).

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

- [Deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Appliance](deploy-console-ova.html) to vCenter Server.
- The vCenter Server instance must be correctly configured for <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. For information about the vCenter Server requirements, see [Virtual Infrastructure Prerequisites](ova-deployment-prereqs.html#infrastructure-prereqs).
- Depending on the type of networking to use, your infrastructure must meet the appropriate prerequisites. For information about networking prerequisites, see the following topics:
  - [Prerequisites for an Unprepared NSX-T Data Center](ova-deployment-prereqs.html#nsxt-not-prepared-prereqs)
  - [Prerequisites for a Prepared NSX-T Data Center](ova-deployment-prereqs.html#nsxt-prepared-prereqs)
  - [Prerequisites for a Flannel Network](ova-deployment-prereqs.html#flannel-prereqs)
- [Log In to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console](deploy-console-ova.html#access-console).
- You have copied an existing YAML configuration file from a previous <%= vars.product_short %> deployment to your local machine.
- You are familiar with editing YAML configuration files for <%= vars.product_short %>.
