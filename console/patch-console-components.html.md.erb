<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You can use VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to update some of the components of your deployment individually. When a new minor version of one or more <%= vars.product_short %> components becomes available, a message appears at the top of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to inform you <code>There are new patches to the VMware Enterprise PKS components</code>.

1. In <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, go to **Configuration** &gt; **PKS Component Patch** to see the list of components that are ready for patching. 
1. If you deployed <%= vars.product_short %> to an air-gapped environment that does not have access to the external internet, 
the **Import Patch** button to import the new versions of the component installers.
1. If your deployment is not air-gapped, use the **Download** buttons to download the appropriate installers directly. 
1. When the downloads are complete, select **Install Patch** to patch a component.
