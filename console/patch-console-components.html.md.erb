You can use VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to update some of the components of your deployment individually. When a new minor version of one or more <%= vars.product_short %> components is available, a message appears at the top of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to inform you <code>There are new patches to the VMware Enterprise PKS components</code>.

1. View the list of components that are ready for patching. 
  You can access the list of components in two ways:
  - Click the **More Info** button in the message at the top of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console.
  - Go to **Configuration** &gt; **PKS Component Patch**.
1. Obtain the patch installers. 
  - In air-gapped environments, download the patch installer from https://downloads.vmware.com/ to a local location. Click the **Import Patch** button to upload the installer to the management console.
  - In environments with access to the internet, click the **Download** button next to the relevant components to import the patch installers directly.
