This topic describes how <%= vars.product_full %> manages the deployment of Kubernetes clusters.

##<a id="overview"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Overview

An <%= vars.product_short %> environment consists of a PKS Control Plane 
and one or more workload clusters.  

<%= vars.product_short %> administrators use the PKS Control Plane to 
deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters. The workload clusters run the apps pushed by developers.  

The following illustrates the interaction between <%= vars.product_short %> components:

Administrators access the PKS Control Plane 
through the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) installed on their local workstations.  

Within the PKS Control Plane the PKS API and PKS Broker use BOSH to execute the requested cluster management functions. 
For information about the PKS Control Plane, see [PKS Control Plane Overview](#control-plane) below. 
For instructions on installing the PKS CLI, see [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html).  

Kubernetes deploys and manages workloads on Kubernetes clusters.
Administrators use the  Kubernetes CLI, `kubectl`, to direct Kubernetes 
from their local workstations. 
For information about `kubectl`, see [Overview of kubectl]
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) in the Kubernetes documentation.  

##<a id="cluster-management"></a><a id="control-plane"></a>PKS Control Plane Overview

The PKS Control Plane manages the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters deployed 
using <%= vars.product_short %>. 

The control plane provides the following via the PKS API:

* View cluster plans
* Create clusters
* View information about clusters
* Obtain credentials to deploy workloads to clusters
* Scale clusters
* Delete clusters
* Create and manage network profiles for VMware NSX-T

In addition, the PKS Control Plane can upgrade all existing clusters using the **Upgrade all clusters** BOSH errand.
For more information, see [Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters](upgrade-pks.html#upgrade-instances) in _Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (Flannel Networking)_.

<br>
PKS Control Plane is hosted on a pair of VM groups:

* The [<%= vars.control_plane %> VM Group](#pks-api-vm) for hosting cluster management services.
* The [<%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM Cluster](#pks-db-vm) to store cluster management data. 

###<a id="pks-api-vm"></a><%= vars.control_plane %> VM Group

The instances in the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM Group host the following services:

* User Account and Authentication (UAA)  
* PKS API  
* PKS Broker
* Billing and Telemetry 

The following sections describe UAA, PKS API, and PKS Broker services,
the primary services hosted on the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM.

####<a id="uaa"></a>UAA

When a user logs in to or logs out of the PKS API through the PKS CLI, the PKS CLI communicates with UAA to authenticate them.
The PKS API permits only authenticated users to manage Kubernetes clusters.
For more information about authenticating, see [PKS API Authentication](pks-api-auth.html).

UAA must be configured with the appropriate users and user permissions.
For more information, see [Managing <%= vars.product_short %> Users with UAA](manage-users.html).

####<a id="pks-api"></a>PKS API

Through the PKS CLI, users instruct the PKS API service to deploy, scale up, and delete Kubernetes clusters as well as show cluster details and plans.
The PKS API can also write Kubernetes cluster credentials to a local kubeconfig file, which enables users to connect to a cluster through `kubectl`.

On AWS, GCP, and vSphere without NSX-T deployments the PKS CLI communicates with the 
PKS API within the control plane via the PKS API Load Balancer. 
On vSphere with NSX-T deployments the <%= vars.control_plane %> host is accessible via a DNAT rule. 
For information about enabling the PKS API on vSphere with NSX-T, see the 
[Share the PKS API Endpoint](installing-nsx-t.html#retrieve-endpoint) section in 
_Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Integration_.

The PKS API sends all cluster management requests, except read-only requests, to the PKS Broker.

####<a id="pks-broker"></a>PKS Broker

When the PKS API receives a request to modify a Kubernetes cluster, it instructs the PKS Broker to make the requested change.

The PKS Broker consists of an [On-Demand Service Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/index.html) and a Service Adapter. The PKS Broker generates a BOSH manifest and instructs the BOSH Director to deploy or delete the Kubernetes cluster.

For <%= vars.product_short %> deployments on vSphere with NSX-T, there is an additional component, the <%= vars.product_short %> NSX-T Proxy Broker.
The PKS API communicates with the PKS NSX-T Proxy Broker, which in turn communicates with the NSX Manager to provision the Node Networking resources.
The PKS NSX-T Proxy Broker then forwards the request to the On-Demand Service Broker to deploy the cluster.

###<a id="pks-db-vm"></a><%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM Cluster

The instances in the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM Cluster host MySQL, proxy, and other data-related services. 
These data-related functions persist PKS Control Plane data for the the following services:

* PKS API
* UAA
* Billing
* Telemetry

##<a id="azs"></a>Availability Zones

<%= vars.product_short %> uses Availability Zones (AZs) to provide high availability for Kubernetes cluster workers.

When an operator creates Plans for developers, they assign AZs to the Plans. 
Assigning multiple AZs to a Plan allows developers to provide high-availability for their worker clusters. 
When a cluster has more than one node, 
Ops Manager balances those nodes across the Availability Zones assigned to the cluster. 

Public-cloud IaaSes such as AWS and Azure provide AZs as part of their service.
In vSphere with NSX-T, you define and create AZs using vCenter clusters and resource pools.
See [Step 4: Create Availability Zones](./vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#create-az) in _Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for Enterprise PKS_ for how to create AZs in NSX-T.

For instructions on selecting AZs for your <%= vars.product_short %> Plans, 
see [Plans](installing-nsx-t.html#plans) 
in _Installing Enterprise PKS on vSphere with NSX-T_.  

For instructions on selecting the AZ for the <%= vars.product_short %> control plane, 
see [Assign AZs and Networks](installing-nsx-t.html#azs-networks) 
in _Installing Enterprise PKS on vSphere with NSX-T_.  

##<a id="overview-ha"></a>High Availability Modes

<%= vars.product_short %> can be configured for PKS Control Plane and workload high availability.   

####<a id="control-plane-ha"></a>PKS Control Plane High Availability Mode (Beta)

The PKS Control Plane can be configured in either standard or high availability (beta) modes.

* In standard mode:  
    * The <%= vars.control_plane %> is hosted on the `pivotal-container-service` VM.
    * The <%= vars.control_plane_db %> is hosted on the `pks-db` VM.
* In high availability mode (beta):  
    * The <%= vars.control_plane %> is hosted on multiple `pivotal-container-service` VMs.
    * The <%= vars.control_plane_db %> is hosted on three `pks-db` VMs.
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> High availability mode is a beta feature.
	Do not scale your <strong>PKS API</strong> or <strong>PKS Database</strong>
	to more than one instance in production environments.
</p>

The following illustrates the interaction between <%= vars.product_short %> components in high availability mode:

####<a id='windows-ha'></a>Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Cluster (Beta) High Availability

Windows worker-based cluster (beta) Linux nodes can be configured in either standard or high availability modes.

* In standard mode, a single Master/etcd node and a single Linux worker manage a cluster's Windows Kubernetes VMs.  
* In high availability mode, 
multiple Master/etcd and Linux worker nodes manage a cluster's Windows Kubernetes VMs.  

The following illustrates the interaction between the 
<%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane and Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters:

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> Windows worker-based clusters for high availability, set these fields in the **Plan** pane as described in [Plans](windows-pks-beta.html#plans) in _Configuring Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Clusters (Beta)_:

* **Enable HA Linux workers**
* **Master/ETCD Node Instances**
* **Worker Node Instances**
