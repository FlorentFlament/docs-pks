title: Deleting Clusters
owner: PKS

Follow the steps below to delete a cluster using the PKS CLI. Running the `pks delete-cluster` command automatically deletes all cluster objects. See [vSphere with NSX-T Cluster Objects](vsphere-nsxt-cluster-objects.html) for a list of vSphere and NSX-T objects that will be deleted.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. Run `pks delete-cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to delete a cluster. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks delete-cluster my-cluster</pre>

1. To verify cluster deletion, run the command `pks clusters`. The cluster you deleted should no longer appear in the list.

1. In some cases using the `pks delete-cluster` will fail to delete a cluster. Typically this occurs if the cluster fails to be created successfully. In such a case you will need to delete the cluster manually using the BOSH CLI. See the troubleshooting section [Cannot Re-Create a Cluster that Failed to Deploy](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/troubleshoot-issues.html#cluster-recreate-fails) for guidance.
