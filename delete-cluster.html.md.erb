title: Deleting Clusters
owner: PKS

Follow the steps below to delete a cluster using the PKS CLI. Running the `pks delete-cluster` command automatically deletes all cluster objects. See [vSphere with NSX-T Cluster Objects](vsphere-nsxt-cluster-objects.html) for a list of vSphere and NSX-T objects that will be deleted.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. Run `pks delete-cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to delete a cluster. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks delete-cluster my-cluster</pre>

1. To verify cluster deletion, run the command `pks clusters`. The cluster you deleted should no longer appear in the list. Alternatively, run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster. The command should return "Cluster not found."

1. If the cluster is not deleted, see [Cluster Deletion Fails](./troubleshoot-issues.html#cluster-delete-fail) in [Diagnosing and Troubleshooting PKS](./troubleshoot.htm).
