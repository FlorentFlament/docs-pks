This section describes how to enable and use the DenyEscalatingExec admission controller for <%= vars.product_full %> clusters. 

##<a id='about-deny-esc-exe'></a> About the DenyEscalatingExec Admission Plugin

The DenyEscalatingExec admission controller denies the "exec" and "attach" commands to pods that run with escalated privileges that allow host access. This includes pods that run as privileged, have access to the host IPC namespace, and have access to the host PID namespace. 

See [Using Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) in the Kubernetes documentation for more information.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The DenyEscalatingExec admission plugin is deprecated and will be removed in Kubernetes v1.18. The recommendation is to use PodSecurityPolicy or a custom admission plugin that can be targeted at specific users or namespaces and also protects against creation of overly privileged pods.</p>

##<a id='enable-deny-esc-exe'></a> Enabling the DenyEscalatingExec Admission Plugin

If checked (enabled), the admission controller will be disabled. Clusters in this plan can then create security vulnerabilities and may impact other tiles. Enable with caution.

To enable the DenyEscalatingExec admission plugin:

1. In the PKS tile, select the desired Plan, such as Plan 1.
1. At the bottom of the configuration panel, select the **DenyEscalatingExec** option.
