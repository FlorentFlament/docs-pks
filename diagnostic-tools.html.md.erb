##<a id='pks-cli'></a>Verify PKS CLI Version

The Pivotal Container Service (PKS) CLI interacts with the your PKS deployment through the PKS API endpoint. You create, manage, and delete Kubernetes clusters on your PKS deployment by entering commands in the PKS CLI. The PKS CLI is under active development and commands may change between versions.

To determine the version of PKS CLI installed locally, run the following command:
  <pre>pks --version</pre>

  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks --version
PKS CLI version: 1.0.0-build.3</pre>

##<a id='bosh-pks-map'></a>View Log Files

Log files contain error messages and other information you can use to diagnose issues with your PKS deployment. SSH into the PKS VM then follow the steps below to access PKS log files.

  <pre>sudo su</pre>


1. To navigate to the PKS VM's `/var/vcap/sys/log` log file directory, run the following command:
  <pre>cd /var/vcap/sys/log</pre>
