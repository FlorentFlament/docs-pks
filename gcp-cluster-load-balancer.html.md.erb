title: Configuring a GCP Load Balancer for PKS Clusters
owner: PKS

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) load balancer
for a Kubernetes cluster deployed by Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

##<a id="overview"></a> Overview

A load balancer is a third-party device that distributes network and application
traffic across resources. You can use a load balancer to access a PKS-deployed cluster
from outside the network using the PKS API and `kubectl`. Using a load balancer
can also prevent individual network components from being overloaded by high
traffic.

You can configure GCP load balancers only for PKS clusters that are deployed on GCP.

To configure a GCP load balancer, follow the procedures below:

1. [Create a GCP Load Balancer](#create)
1. [Create the Cluster](#create-cluster)
1. [Configure Load Balancer Back End](#backend)
1. [Create a Network Tag](#tag)
1. [Create Firewall Rules](#firewall)
1. [Access the Cluster](#access)

To reconfigure a cluster load balancer, follow the procedures in [Reconfigure Load Balancer](#reconfigure).

##<a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

The procedures in this topic have the following prerequisites:

* To complete these procedures, you must have already configured a load balancer
to access the PKS API. For more information, see [Creating a GCP Load Balancer
for the PKS API](gcp-api-load-balancer.html).
* The version of the PKS CLI you are using must match the version of the PKS tile you are installing.

##<a id="configure"></a> Configure GCP Load Balancer

Follow the procedures in this section to create and configure a load balancer
for PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters using GCP. Modify the example commands
in these procedures to match your PKS installation.

###<a id="create"></a> Create a GCP Load Balancer

Perform the following steps to create a GCP load balancer for your PKS clusters:

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. In the sidebar menu, select **Network Services** > **Load balancing**.
1. Click **Create a Load Balancer**.
1. In the **TCP Load Balancing** pane, click **Start configuration**.
1. Click **Continue**. The **New TCP load balancer** menu opens.
1. Give the load balancer a name. For example, `my-cluster`.
1. Click **Frontend configuration** and configure the following settings:
  1. Click **IP**.
  1. Select **Create IP address**.
  1. Give the IP address a name. For example, `my-cluster-ip`.
  1. Click **Reserve**. GCP assigns an IP address.
  1. In the **Port** field, enter `8443`.
  1. Click **Done** to complete front end configuration.
1. Review your load balancer configuration and click **Create**.

### <a id='create-cluster'></a> Create the Cluster

Follow the procedures in the [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](create-cluster.html#create)
section of _Creating Clusters_. Use the GCP-assigned IP address from the previous step
as the external hostname when you run the `pks create-cluster` command.

### <a id='backend'></a> Configure Load Balancer Back End

Perform the following steps to configure the back end of the load balancer:

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. In the sidebar menu, select **Network Services** > **Load balancing**.
1. Select the load balancer you created for the cluster and select **Configure**.
1. Click **Backend configuration** and configure the following settings:
  1. Select all master VMs for your cluster from the dropdown. To locate the IP addresses and VM IDs of the master VMs, see [Identify Kubernetes Cluster Master VMs](create-cluster.html#master-id) in _Creating Clusters_.
    <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: If master VMs are recreated for any reason, such as a stemcell upgrade, you must reconfigure the load balancer to target the new master VMs. For more information, see the <a href="#reconfigure">Reconfigure Load Balancer</a> section below.</p>
  1. Specify any other configuration options you require and click **Update** to complete back end configuration.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For clusters with multiple master node VMs, health checks on port 8443 are recommended.</p>

###<a id="tag"></a> Create a Network Tag

Perform the following steps to create a network tag:

1. In the Google Cloud Platform sidebar menu, select **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
1. Filter to find the master instances of your cluster. Type `master` in the **Filter VM Instances** search box and press **Enter**.
1. Click the name of the master instances. The **VM instance details** menu opens.
1. Click **Edit**.
1. Click in the **Network tags** field and type a human-readable name in lower case letters. Press **Enter** to create the network tag.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Save**.

###<a id="firewall"></a> Create Firewall Rules

Perform the following steps to create firewall rules:

1. In the Google Cloud Platform sidebar menu, select **VPC Network** > **Firewall Rules**.
1. Click **Create Firewall Rule**. The **Create a firewall rule** menu opens.
1. Give your firewall rule a human-readable name in lower case letters. For ease of use, you may want to align this name with the name of the load balancer you created in [Create a GCP Load Balancer](#create).
1. In the **Network** menu, select the VPC network on which you have deployed the PKS tile.
1. In the **Direction of traffic** field, select **Ingress**.
1. In the **Action on match** field, select **Allow**.
1. Confirm that the **Targets** menu is set to `Specified target tags` and enter the tag you made in [Create a Network Tag](#tag) in the **Target tags** field.
1. In the **Source filter** field, choose an option to filter source traffic.
1. Based on your choice in the **Source filter** field, specify IP addresses, Subnets, or Source tags to allow access to your cluster.
1. In the **Protocols and ports** field, choose **Specified protocols and ports** and enter the port number you specified in [Create a GCP Load Balancer](#create), prepended by `tcp:`. For example: `tcp:8443`.
1. Specify any other configuration options you require and click **Done** to complete front end configuration.
1. Click **Create**.

###<a id="access"></a> Access the Cluster

Perform the following steps to complete cluster configuration:

1. From your local workstation, run `pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME`.
This command creates a local `kubeconfig` that allows you to manage the cluster.
For more information about the `pks get-credentials` command, see [Retrieving Cluster Credentials and Configuration](cluster-credentials.html).

1. Run `kubectl cluster-info` to confirm you can access your cluster using the Kubernetes CLI.

See [Managing PKS](managing.html) for information about checking cluster health and viewing cluster logs.

##<a id="reconfigure"></a> Reconfigure Load Balancer

If Kubernetes master node VMs are recreated for any reason, you must reconfigure your cluster load balancers to point to the new master VMs.
For example, after a stemcell upgrade, BOSH recreates the VMs in your deployment.

To reconfigure your GCP cluster load balancer to use the new master VMs, do the following:

1. Locate the VM IDs of the new master node VMs for the cluster. For information about locating the VM IDs, see [Identify Kubernetes Cluster Master VMs](create-cluster.html#master-id) in _Creating Clusters_.
1. Navigate to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. In the sidebar menu, select **Network Services > Load balancing**.
1. Select your cluster load balancer and click **Edit**.
1. Click **Backend configuration**.
1. Click **Select existing instances**.
1. Select the new master VM IDs from the dropdown. Use the VM IDs you located in the first step of this procedure.
1. Click **Update**.
