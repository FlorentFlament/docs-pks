title: Monitoring Master/etcd Node VMs

This topic describes how platform operators can monitor and retrieve metrics from
master/etcd node VMs in <%= vars.product_full %> deployments.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

You can configure the Telegraf agent to collect metrics from master/etcd node VMs and send the metrics to a third-party monitoring service.
The Telegraf agent can read metrics from the following:

+ the `/metrics` endpoint exposed by etcd
+ Node Exporter

### <a name="node-exporter"></a>About Node Exporter

Node Exporter exports hardware and operating system metrics in Prometheus format.

In <%= vars.product_tile %>, you can enable the Node Exporter BOSH job
separately on master nodes, worker nodes, and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM.
These settings are located in the **Host Monitoring** pane of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

Node Exporter exposes metrics on <em>localhost</em> only. For a list of Node Exporter metrics,
see the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) GitHub repository.

## <a id="collect"></a>Collect Metrics Using Telegraf

To collect metrics using Telegraf, do the following:

1. Create a configuration file for your output plugin. See [Create a Configuration File](#toml).
1. Configure Telegraf in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. See [Configure Telegraf in the Tile](#connect). 

### <a id="toml"></a> Create a Configuration File 

To connect a third-party monitoring service to <%= vars.product_short %>, you must create a configuration file for the service. The configuration file is written in a TOML format and consists of key-value pairs. After you create your configuration file, you can enter the file into the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile to connect the service. 

To create a configuration file your monitoring service, do the following:

1. Locate the required format for your monitoring service in the `README.md` file for your service in [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/1.11.0/plugins/outputs) in GitHub. The etcd documentation recommends using the open source Prometheus monitoring service.<br><br>
    For more information about using Prometheus, see 
    [Overview](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) in the Prometheus documentation.

1. Create your configuration file using the required format of your monitoring service.
For example, if you want to create a configuration file for an HTTP output plugin, create a file similar to the following: 

    ```
    [[outputs.http]]
       url="https://example.com"
       method="POST"
       data_format="json"
    [[processors.override]]
      [processors.override.tags]
        director = "bosh-director-1"
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  You can add tags to your configuration file to label etcd metrics. For example, the above code snippet adds a <code>bosh-director-1</code> tag to the etcd metrics. If you have multiple BOSH Directors, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends adding tags to filter your metrics in your monitoring service. </p>

### <a id="connect"></a> Configure Telegraf in the Tile

To configure Telegraf in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile,
follow the instructions in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
For example, if your are installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere,
follow the instructions in the [Telegraf](installing-pks-vsphere.html#telegraf) section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere_.

## <a id="errors"></a>Troubleshoot etcd

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends working with Support to troubleshoot master/etcd node VMs.
The monitoring and metrics data you retrieve from the master/etcd node VMs
can help the Support team diagnose and troubleshoot errors.
