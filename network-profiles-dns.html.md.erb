<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to define network profile for performing DNS lookup of the pre-provisioned IP addresses for the Kubernetes API load balancer and ingress controller.

## <a id='about'></a> About DNS Lookup of Pre-Provisioned IP Addresses

In an Enterprise PKS environment on NSX-T, when you provision a Kubernetes cluster using the command `pks create-cluster`, NSX-T creates a layer 4 load balancer that fronts the Kubernetes API server running on the master node(s). In addition, NCP creates two layer 7 virtual servers (HTTP and HTTPS) as the ingress controller for inbound traffic to Kubernetes pods.

The IP addresses that are assigned to the API load balancer and ingress controller are derived from the floating IP pool in NSX-T. These IP addresses are not known in advance, and you have to wait for the IP addresses to be allocated to know what they are so you can update your DNS records. 

If you want to pre-provision these IP addresses, you define a network profile to lookup the IP addresses for these components from your DNS server. In this way you can tell PKS what IP addresses to use for these resources when the cluster is created, and be able to have DNS records for them so FQDNs can be used.

## <a id="params"></a> DNS Lookup Parameters

Using the `dns_lookup_mode` parameter, you can define a network profile to specify the lookup mode: `API` or `API_INGRESS`. If the mode is `API`, PKS will perform a lookup of the pre-provisioned IP address for the Kubernetes API load balancer. If the mode is `API_INGRESS`, PKS will perform a lookup of the pre-provisioned IP addresses for the Kubernetes API load balancer and the ingress controller.

The IP addresses used must come from the floating IP pool. The floating IP pool, if not specified in the network profile, will come from the PKS tile configuration.

The DNS lookup, whether for the Kubernetes master(s) load balancer or the ingress controller, is performed in the Kubernetes master VM using the DNS server(s) configured in the PKS tile or the `nodes_dns` field in the network profile.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Kubernetes ingress controllers can be configured on the host or path. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Kubernetes ingress documentation</a>. The current implementation of the DNS lookup feature for ingress controllers only support the PATH capability.</p>

## <a id='dns-lookup-lb'></a> Example API Load Balancer Lookup

The following network profile, api.json, triggers a DNS lookup for the Kubernetes master node(s) IP address. In this example, a custom floating IP pool is specified, and DNS servers. If these parameters are not specified, the values in the PKS tile are used.

```
{
    "name": "example-network-profile",
    "description": "Network profile using API lookup mode",
    "parameters": {
      "nodes_dns": [
        "8.8.8.8", "192.168.115.1", "192.168.116.1"
        ],		    
      "fip_pool_ids": [
        "ENTER-FIP-POOL-ID1",
        "ENTER-FIP-POOL-ID2" 
        ],
      "dns_lookup_mode": "API"
    }
}
```

## <a id='dns-lookup-ingress'></a> Performing DNS Lookup of the Ingress Controller Using Network Profile

The following example network profile, api_ingress.json, triggers a DNS lookup for the Kubernetes master node(s) IP address and the ingress controller IP address.

```
{
    "name": "api_ingress",
    "description": "Network profile using API_INGRESS dns lookup mode",
    "parameters": {
        "fip_pool_ids": [
            "ENTER-FIP-POOL-ID1",
            "ENTER-FIP-POOL-ID2"
        ],
        "dns_lookup_mode": "API_INGRESS",
        "ingress_prefix": "ingress"
    }
}
```

## <a id='dns-workflow'></a> Workflow for Implementing DNS Lookup

Consider the following workflow when implementing DNS lookup for the Kubernetes API server, the ingress controller, or both.

1. Choose a valid IP address for the Kubernetes API server load balancer and for the ingress controller. Each IP address should be allocated from the floating IP pool configured for <%= vars.product_short %>, either in the PKS Tile or a custom floating IP pool using a network profile.
1. Create a DNS record (A-Record) with the IPs and FQDNs for the Kubernetes API server and ingress controller.
1. Provision a Kubernetes cluster using a network profile set with `dns_lookup_mode` (API or API_INGRESS) and the FQDN specified for the API Server in the CLI with `-e` option, or the ingress controller prefix set in the network profile.
1. At runtime, PKS does a lookup based on the PKS Tile configuration or the Node DNS configured in the Network Profile to assign the specified IPs to the API and Ingress Controller, the assignment happens only when the allocation from the floating IP Pool succeeds.
1. If the IP address cannot be allocated, cluster creation fails.

## <a id='command-line'></a> Setting the Master Node IP Address on the Command Line

As an alternative to DNS lookup, you can specify a fixed IP address in the command line so that it will be used for the Kubernetes master node(s) load balancer. 

Previously, to create a cluster, you were required to specify an external hostname for the cluster. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks create-cluster my-cluster --external-hostname example.hostname --plan small
</pre>

Now you can specify the IP address for the load balancer that fronts the Kubernetes master node(s) using the `--external-hostname` or `-e` flag. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks create-cluster my-cluster -e 192.168.160.20 -p small
</pre>
 
The IP address that you use must belong to a valid floating IP pool created in NSX-T.
