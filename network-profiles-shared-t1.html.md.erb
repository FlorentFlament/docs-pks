This topic describes how to define network profiles to enable Kubernetes clusters to use a shared Tier-1 Router.

## <a id='shared-t1-about'></a> About the Shared Tier-1 Topology

A Shared Tier-1 network topology provides an alternative approach for deploying Kubernetes clusters.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Shared Tier-1 topology requires NSX-T Data Center v2.5.</p>

By default when a Kubernetes cluster is provisioned by <%= vars.product_short %>, the system creates following NSX-T objects: 

* 1 Logical Switch and Tier-1 Router for each Kubernetes Nodes subnet
* 1 Logical Switch and Tier-1 Router for each Kubernetes namespace
* 1 Logical Switch and Tier-1 Router each NSX-T Load Balancer that is allocated for the Kubernetes cluster

As depicted, the result is that a given Kubernetes cluster will run several Tier-1 switches and routers in its topology.

An alternative topology is to use a single, shared Tier-1 switch and router for each Kubernetes cluster. As depicted, the shared Tier-1 model only uses one Tier-1 router and multiple logical switches connected to the shared Tier-1 to connect all Kubernetes cluster components, including:

* Kubernetes Nodes Networks 
* Kubernetes Namespaces
* NSX-T load balancer instances allocated for the Kubernetes cluster

The shared Tier-1 model configures any necessary NAT rules (if using NAT mode) on the single Tier-1 router directly. The Tier-0 router is no longer used for any NAT configuration. As a result, the Tier-0 router can operate in Active/Active mode if all Kubernetes clusters are deployed using the Shared Tier-1 model. The Shared Tier-1 model enables higher scale numbers for PKS as number of NSX-T objects allocated per Kubernetes cluster is drastically reduced. The advantage of the shared Tier-1 topology is that you can increase the number of NSX-T objects that can be supported in a given cluster. 

## <a id='shared-t1-implement'></a> Implementing a Single Tier Topology

To implement a shared Tier-1 topology, you define a network profile that enables the `single_tier_topology` key. Shown below is an example network profile to enable a Shared Tier-1 Router for Kubernetes clusters:

```
{
  "name": "example-network-profile-shared-t1",
  "description": "Shared-Tier-1 topology network profile",
  "parameters": {
    "single_tier_topology": true
  }
}
```

To create a Shared Tier-1 network profile, see [Create Network Profile](./network-profiles.html#create-profile).

To create a cluster using a Shared Tier-1 network profile, see [Create a Cluster with a Network Profile](./network-profiles.html#create-cluster).
