title: Using Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)
owner: PKS
---

This topic describes how to use network profiles for Kubernetes clusters
provisioned with <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

Network profiles let you customize NSX-T configuration parameters.

## <a id="how-created"></a> How Network Profiles are Created

<%= vars.product_short %> cluster administrators can create and delete network profiles, as described in the [Creating and Managing Network Profiles](./network-profiles-define.html) topic.

After an administrator creates a network profile, cluster managers can create clusters with it or assign it to existing clusters.

## <a id="list-profiles"></a> List Network Profiles

To list available network profiles, run the following command:

```
pks network-profiles
```

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks network-profiles

	Name				Description 
	lb-profile-medium	Network profile for medium size NSX-T load balancer
	small-routable-pod 	Network profile with small load balancer and two routable pod networks
</pre>

## <a id='create'></a> Create a Cluster with a Network Profile

You can assign a network profile to a Kubernetes cluster at the time of cluster creation.

To create an <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster with a network profile, run the following command:

```
pks create-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --external-hostname HOSTNAME --plan PLAN-NAME --network-profile NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
```

Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAME` is a unique name for your cluster.
* `HOSTNAME` is your external hostname used for accessing the Kubernetes API.
* `PLAN-NAME` is the name of the <%= vars.product_short %> plan you want to use for your cluster.
* `NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile you want to use for your cluster.

## <a id="update-profile"></a> Assign a Network Profile to an Existing Cluster
 
PKS supports changing the network profile for an already created cluster.
You can use this procedure to assign a network profile to a cluster that has no network profile, or to change a cluster's existing profile to a different one.

To change the network profile, you create a new network profile and then apply it to the existing cluster.

Currently you only can change the `pod_ip_block_ids` field as follows:

- Reorder the IP Block IDs in the array
- Add more IP Block IDs in the array

For more information on the `pod_ip_block_ids` field, see [Network Profile Parameters](./network-profiles-define.html#params). 
For more information on the supported use cases for the `pod_ip_block_ids` field, see [Network Profile Use Cases](./network-profiles-define.html#use-cases).

To update the `pod_ip_block_ids` network profile field for a cluster, do the following:

1. Define a new network profile. In the `pod_ip_block_ids` field, reorder the IP Block IDs or add additional IP Block IDs.
For more information on defining the network profile JSON file, see [Defining Network Profiles](./network-profiles-define.html).

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If possible, start with the exact contents of the original network profile and update the <code>pod_ip_block_ids</code> field, as well as the <code>name</code> field. If it is not possible to obtain the original network profile, create a new network profile with a unique <code>name</code> and the original values in the <code>pod_ip_block_ids</code> field. Then reorder or add IPs as desired.</p>

1. Create a new network profile as described in the [Create a Network Profile](./network-profiles.html#create-profile) section. 

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The name that you specify for the new network profile must be unique and differ from the previously assigned network profile. Otherwise, you receive an error when you try to create the network profile.</p>

1. Run the following command to update the cluster with the new network profile:

    ```
    pks update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --network-profile NEW-NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
    ```

    Where: 
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the existing Kubernetes cluster 
    * `NEW-NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the new network profile you want to apply to the cluster.

### <a id="network-profile-validation"></a> Network Profile Update Validation

There are strict validation rules for the `pks update-cluster --network-profile` command:

- If a field in the original network profile is empty, the system ignores the empty field even if the field is included in the new network profile. 
- If the existing `pod_ip_block_ids` field contains the same entries as the new network profile, the `update-cluster --network-profile` operation passes validation. 
- If a field in the existing network profile conflicts with a field in the new network profile, the system reports the conflict and fails the validation.
- If the field is empty in the new network profile, then the system ignores the field even if the field is not empty in the original network profile.

## <a id="network-details"></a> View NSX-T Network Details

You can use the following [PKS CLI command](./cli/index.html) to view NSX-T network details: 

```
pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME --details
```

Where CLUSTER-NAME is the name of a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by Enterprise PKS.
