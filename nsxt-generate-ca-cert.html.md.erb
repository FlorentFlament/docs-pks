This topic describes how to generate and register the NSX Manager certificate authority (CA) certificate in preparation for installing <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T.

##<a id='nsx-mgr-cert-about'></a> Overview

The NSX Manager CA certificate is an IP-based, self-signed certificate that you create and register with the NSX Manager.
The NSX Manager CA certificate is used to authenticate <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX Manager
during <%= vars.product_short %> installation on vSphere with NSX-T.

Both the BOSH Director and <%= vars.product_short %> tiles require the NSX Manager CA certificate when on vSphere with NSX-T.
Ops Manager requires strict certificate validation and requires the subject and issuer of a self-signed certificate to be either the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the NSX Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the NSX Manager includes a self-signed API certificate with both the subject and issuer populated with hostname instead of IP address or FQDN.
You must generate a valid self-signed certificate.
</p>

You can use either of the following methods to generate your NSX Manager CA certificate:

* [Generate the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Cluster Virtual IP](#vip)
* [Generate the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Load Balancer IP](#lb)

You can then register the generated certificate with the NSX Manager using the NSX API:

* [Register the Cluster Virtual IP NSX-T Root CA Certificate](#vip-register)
* [Register the  Load Balancer IP NSX-T Root CA Certificate](#lb-register)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following instructions are specific to NSX-T v2.4.1.</p>

##<a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

Before you generate and register an NSX Manager CA certificate, ensure that you have successfully completed all of the following steps:

* [Preparing to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html)
* [Hardware Requirements for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T](vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html)
* [Create Management Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-plane) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_
* [Create IP Blocks and Pool for Compute Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-ip-blocks-pool) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_
* [Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>](vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html)

Before configuring your BOSH and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tiles with your NSX Manager CA certificate, ensure that you
have successfully completed the steps in [Install <%= vars.product_short %>](installing-nsx-t.html#install) in _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T_.

For configuration information, see the [Networking](installing-nsx-t.html#networking) section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T_.

##<a id="vip"></a> Generate the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Cluster Virtual IP Address

The NSX-T Management Cluster is comprised of three NSX-T Manager nodes. You can configure the NSX-T Manager UI and API to support a single access point by assigning a virtual IP address (VIP) to the NSX-T Management Cluster.

![NSX-T Root CA Cert Configuration Using VIP](images/nsxt/mgmt-cluster/mgmt-cluster-01b.png)

To generate an NSX-T Management Cluster root CA certificate using your NSX Management Cluster VIP, complete the following steps:

* [Configure a VIP for the NSX-T Management Cluster](#vip1)
* [Define the Certificate Signing Request Using the VIP](#vip2)
* [Generate the VIP Certificate and Private Key](#vip3)

###<a id="vip1"></a> Configure a VIP for the NSX-T Management Cluster

The NSX-T Management Cluster VIP IP address is used to configure the NSX-T Management Cluster certificate.

1. To support a single access point for the NSX Manager API, complete the steps in
[Configure the NSX-T Management VIP](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-vip) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_.

###<a id="vip2"></a> Define the Certificate Signing Request Using the VIP

To define the Certificate Signing Request, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file named `nsx-cert.cnf`.

1. Complete the CSR file using the following template:

    ```
    [ req ]
    default_bits = 2048
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    req_extensions = req_ext
    prompt = no
    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    countryName = COUNTRY-INIT
    stateOrProvinceName = STATE
    localityName = STATE-INIT
    organizationName = NSX
    commonName = IP-ADDRESS
    [ req_ext ]
    subjectAltName = @alt_names
    [alt_names]
    DNS.1 = IP-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where:
    * `COUNTRY-INIT` are the initials for your corporation's country of origin.
    * `STATE` is your corporation's state or province.
    * `STATE-INIT` are the initials for your corporation's state or province.
    * `IP-ADDRESS` is your Management Cluster VIP IP address.

    For example:

    ```
    [ req ]
    default_bits = 2048
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    req_extensions = req_ext
    prompt = no
    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    countryName = US
    stateOrProvinceName = California
    localityName = CA
    organizationName = NSX
    commonName = 10.40.206.5
    [ req_ext ]
    subjectAltName = @alt_names
    [alt_names]
    DNS.1 = IP-ADDRESS
    ```
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Cluster VIP IP address must be used as the <code>commonName</code> attribute value because the certificate will be registered as a Cluster CA certificate, not as a Node CA certificate.
</p>
1. Copy the completed `nsx-cert.cnf` file to a Linux-based VM that is on the same network as the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Plane.

###<a id='vip3'></a> Generate the VIP Certificate and Private Key

To use your new CSR to generate a certificate and private key, complete the following commands:

1. To export the `NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS` and `NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME` environment variables, run the following command:

    ```
    export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=IP-ADDRESS
    export NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME=IP-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where `IP-ADDRESS` is your Management Cluster VIP IP Address.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ export NSX\_MANAGER\_IP\_ADDRESS=10.40.206.5
    $ export NSX\_MANAGER\_COMMONNAME=10.40.206.5
    </pre>

1. To use the above CSR to generate the certificate and private key files, `nsx.crt` and `nsx.key`, run the following command:

    ```
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes \
    > -keyout nsx.key -new -out nsx.crt -subj /CN=$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME \
    > -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat ./nsx-cert.cnf \
    >  <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME,IP:$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS")) -sha256 -days 365
    ```

1. To verify the certificate, run the following command:

    ```
    openssl x509 -in nsx.crt -text -noout
    ```

##<a id="vip-register"></a> Register the Cluster Virtual IP Certificate

To register the Cluster Virtual IP NSX-T Root CA certificate, complete the following:

* [Import the VIP Certificate to NSX Manager](#vip4)
* [Register the VIP Certificate Using the Cluster Certificate API](#vip5)
