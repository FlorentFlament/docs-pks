<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to generate and register the NSX Manager certificate authority (CA) certificate in preparation 
for installing <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T.

##<a id='nsx-mgr-cert-about'></a> Overview

The NSX Manager certificate is an IP-based, self-signed certificate you create and register with the NSX Manager. 
The NSX Manager certificate is used to authenticate <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX Manager 
during <%= vars.product_short %> installation on vSphere with NSX-T. 
Both the BOSH Director and <%= vars.product_short %> tiles require the NSX Manager CA certificate when on vSphere with NSX-T.  

Ops Manager requires strict certificate validation and requires the subject and issuer of a self-signed certificate 
to be either the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the NSX Manager. 
By default, the NSX Manager includes a self-signed API certificate with both the subject and issuer 
populated with hostname instead of IP address or FQDN. 
You must generate a valid self-signed certificate. You can use either of the following methods to generate the certificate:  

* [Generate and Register the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Cluster Virtual IP](#vip)  
* [Generate and Register the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Load Balancer IP](lb)  

You can then register the valid certificate with the NSX Manager using the NSX API .

For configuration information, see the [Networking](installing-nsx-t.html#networking) section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T_.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following instructions are specific to NSX-T v2.4.1.</p>

##<a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

Before you generate and register an NSX Manager certificate,
ensure you have successfully completed all <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T installation steps, including:  

* [Preparing to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html)  
* [Installing and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>](vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html)  
* [Creating the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane](nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html)  
* [Create <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Plane](nsxt-prepare-compute-plane.html)  
* [Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>](vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html)  


##<a id="vip"></a> Generate and Register the NSX-T Root CA Certificate using the Cluster Virtual IP

You will generate and register the NSX-T root CA certificate using the NSX Management Cluster Virtual IP (VIP).  

![NSX-T Root CA Cert Configuration Using VIP](images/nsxt/mgmt-cluster/mgmt-cluster-01b.png)

To generate and register the certificate using the Cluster Virtual IP, complete the following:

* [Configure a VIP for the NSX-T Management Cluster](#vip1)  
* [Define the Certificate Signing Request Using the VIP](#vip2)  
* [Generate the VIP Certificate and Private Key](#vip3)  
* [Import the VIP Certificate to NSX Manager](#vip4)  
* [Register the VIP Certificate Using the Cluster Certificate API](#vip5)  
* [Verify the VIP Certificate](#vip6)  
* [Add the VIP Certificate to BOSH and PKS Tiles](#vip7)

###<a id="vip1"></a> Configure a VIP for the NSX-T Management Cluster  

The NSX-T Management Cluster Virtual IP IP address is used to configure the NSX-T Management Cluster certificate. 

1. To support a single access point for the NSX Manager API, complete the steps in 
[Assign a Virtual IP Address to the NSX-T Management Cluster](./nsxt-install-mgmt-vip.html).  

###<a id="vip2"></a> Define the Certificate Signing Request Using the VIP

To define the Certificate Signing Request, complete the following steps:  

1. Create a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file named `nsx-cert.cnf`. 

1. Complete the CSR file using the following template:

    ```
    [ req ]
    default_bits = 2048
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    req_extensions = req_ext
    prompt = no
    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    countryName = COUNTRY
    stateOrProvinceName = STATE
    localityName = STATE-INIT
    organizationName = NSX
    commonName = IP-ADDRESS
    [ req_ext ]
    subjectAltName = @alt_names
    [alt_names]
    DNS.1 
    ```

    Where:  
    * `COUNTRY` are the initials for your corporation's country of origin.  
    * `STATE` is your corporation's state or province.  
    * `STATE-INIT` are the initials for your corporation's state or province.  
    * `IP-ADDRESS` is your Management Cluster VIP IP address

    For example:  

    ```
    [ req ]
    default_bits = 2048
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    req_extensions = req_ext
    prompt = no
    [ req_distinguished_name ]
    countryName = US
    stateOrProvinceName = California
    localityName = CA
    organizationName = NSX
    commonName = 10.40.206.5
    [ req_ext ]
    subjectAltName = @alt_names
    [alt_names]
    DNS.1 
    ```
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Cluster VIP IP address must be used as the 
  <code>commonName</code> attribute value because the certificate will be registered as a Cluster CA cert, not a Node CA cert.
</p>
1. Copy the completed `nsx-cert.cnf` file to a Linux-based VM that is on the same network as the PKS Management Plane.

###<a id='vip3'></a> Generate the VIP Certificate and Private Key

To use your new CSR to generate a certificate and private key, complete the following commands:  

1. To export the `NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS` and `NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME` environment variables, run the following command:

    ```
    export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=IP-ADDRESS
    export NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME=IP-ADDRESS
    ```

    Where: `IP-ADDRESS` is your Management Cluster VIP IP Address

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ export NSX\_MANAGER\_IP\_ADDRESS=10.40.206.5
    $ export NSX\_MANAGER\_COMMONNAME=10.40.206.5
    </pre>

1. To use the above CSR to generate the certificate and private key files, `nsx.crt` and `nsx.key`, run the following command:

    ```
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes \
    > -keyout nsx.key -new -out nsx.crt -subj /CN=$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME \
    > -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat ./nsx-cert.cnf \
    >  <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME,IP:$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS")) -sha256 -days 365
    ```

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes \
    \> -keyout nsx.key -new -out nsx.crt -subj /CN=$NSX\_MANAGER\_COMMONNAME \
    \> -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat ./nsx-cert.cnf \
    \>  <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:$NSX\_MANAGER\_COMMONNAME,IP:$NSX\_MANAGER\_IP\_ADDRESS")) -sha256 -days 365
    </pre>

1. To verify the certificate, run the following command:

    ```
    openssl x509 -in nsx.crt -text -noout
    ```

###<a id='vip4'></a> Import the VIP Certificate to NSX Manager

To import the certificate to the NSX Manager, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the NSX Manager UI using the VIP address.
