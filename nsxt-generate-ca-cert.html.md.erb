##<a id='certificates-nsx-mgr'></a> About the NSX Manager CA Certificate

The NSX Manager CA certificate is used to authenticate with the NSX Manager. You create an IP-based, self-signed certificate and register it with the NSX Manager. During <%= vars.product_short %> installation on vSphere with NSX-T, you provide this certificate in the **NSX Manager CA Cert** field in the **Networking** pane in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

See the **NSX Manager CA Cert** field in the following screenshot:

<img src="images/nsxt/nsx-ca-cert.png" alt="NSX Manager CA certificate configuration" width="575">

For configuration information, see the [Networking](installing-nsx-t.html#networking) section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T_.

By default, the NSX Manager includes a self-signed API certificate with its hostname as the subject and issuer. Ops Manager requires strict certificate validation and expects the subject and issuer of the self-signed certificate to be either the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the NSX Manager. As a result, you need to regenerate the self-signed certificate using the FQDN of the NSX Manager in the subject and issuer field and then register the certificate with the NSX Manager using the NSX API.

The **Disable SSL certificate verification** option lets you disable validation of the NSX Manager CA certificate. Select this option for testing purposes only.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>NSX Manager CA Cert</strong> field and the <strong>Disable SSL certificate verification</strong> option are intended to be mutually exclusive. If you disable SSL certificate verification, leave the CA certificate field blank. If you enter a certificate in the <strong>NSX Manager CA Cert</strong> field, do not disable SSL certificate verification. If you populate the certificate field and disable certificate validation, insecure mode takes precedence.</p>

##<a id="s1"></a> Step 1: Configure a VIP or Load Balancer for the NSX Management Cluster

The NSX-T Management Cluster comprises three NSX-T Manager Nodes. To support a single access point for the NSX Manager interface, you need to do one of the following: 

- [Assign a Virtual IP Address to the NSX-T Management Cluster]((./nsxt-install-mgmt-vip.html), or
- [Provision a Load Balancer for the NSX-T v2.4 Management Cluster](./nsxt-install-mgmt-lb.html)

Which approach to choose depends on your requirements. If you need to scale, provision a load balancer for the NSX-T Management Cluster. If you do not require scalability, configure a Cluster VIP to achieve HA for the NSX-T Management Cluster.

The IP address used for the VIP or for the load balancer is needed to configure the NSX-T Managment Cluster certificate. Both the BOSH Director tile and the PKS tile expect the NSX Manager CA certificate. 

##<a id="s2"></a> Step 2: Define the CSR

The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) differs depending on if you used an HA VIP or a load balancer.

###<a id="nsx-cert-vip"></a> CSR Using the HA VIP

Below is an example Certificate Signing Request (CSR) named `nsx-cert.cnf`. In this example, the IP address `10.40.206.5` is the IP address of the VIP. Substitute this IP address with the VIP you generated.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Cluster VIP address must be used as the value for the <code>commonName</code> attribute because the certificate will be registered as a Cluster CA cert, not a Node CA cert. In this case the server response certificate will return with the VIP in it. Therefore, the VIP must be the <code>commonName</code>.</p>

```
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
prompt = no
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = US
stateOrProvinceName = California
localityName = CA
organizationName = NSX
commonName = 10.40.206.5
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = 10.40.206.5
```

###<a id='nsx-cert-fqdn'></a> CSR Using Load Balancer IP

Using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), the `commonName` is a wildcard FQDN (`*.pks.vmware.local`, for example) and the `subjectAltName` (SAN) includes the same wildcard FQDN (`*.pks.vmware.local`, for example) and the load balancer VIP (`192.168.160.100`, for example).

```
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = US
stateOrProvinceName = California
localityName = CA
organizationName = NSX
commonName = *.pks.vmware.local
[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = *.pks.vmware.local
DNS.2  = 192.168.160.100
```

###<a id='nsx-cert-both'></a> CSR Using Both the HA VIP and the Load Balancer IP

If you have previously configured the Cluster HA VIP and then configured a load balancer, an alternative approach is to use the Cluster HA VIP as the `commonName` (`10.196.188.27`, for example), and the `subjectAltName` (SAN) includes the load balancer VIP (`192.168.160.100`, for example) and all 3 of the NSX Manager IP addresses.

```
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
prompt = no
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = US
stateOrProvinceName = California
localityName = CA
organizationName = NSX
commonName = 10.196.188.27
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = 192.168.160.100
DNS.1 = 10.196.188.21
DNS.1 = 10.196.188.22
DNS.1 = 10.196.188.23
```

##<a id='s3'></a> Step 3: Generate the NSX Manager CA Certificate and Private Key

To generate the certificate and private key using the above CSR, complete the following steps.

Define environment variables for the NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS and the NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME depending on your CSR.

For example:

```
export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=*.pks.vmware.local
export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=10.40.206.5,10.40.206.6,10.40.206.7
```

```
export NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME=*.pks.vmware.local
export NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME=10.40.206.10
```

Where:
- NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS is a wildcard FQDN (`*.pks.vmware.local`, for example) or all three of the NSX-T Manager IP addresses. 
- NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME is a wildcard FQDN or the Cluster VIP address. 


```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -keyout nsx.key -new -out nsx.crt -subj /CN=$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat ./nsx-cert.cnf <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME,IP:$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS")) -sha256 -days 365
```


openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes \
> -keyout nsx.key -new -out nsx.crt -subj /CN=$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME \
> -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat ./nsx-cert.cnf \
>  <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:$NSX_MANAGER_COMMONNAME,IP:$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS")) -sha256 -days 365
```

The result is `nsx.crt` and `nsx.key`. 

Verify the certificate using the command `# openssl x509 -in nsx.crt -text -noout`.

##<a id='s4'></a> Step 4: Import the CA Certificate to NSX Manager

Complete the following steps to import the certificate to the NSX Manager:

1. Log in to the NSX Manager UI.

1. Navigate to **System > Trust > Certificates**.

1. Click **Import > Import Certificate**.

  <img src="images/nsxt/import-cert.png" alt="Import the NSX Manager CA certificate to the NSX Manager" width="475">
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you select <strong>Import Certificate</strong> and not <strong>Import CA Certificate</strong>.</p>

1. Give the certificate a unique name, such as `NSX-API-CERT-NEW`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use a unique name for the new certificate you import. The default NSX Manager CA certificate is typically named <code>NSX-API-CERT</code>.</p>

1. Browse to and select the CA certificate and private key you generated in the previous section of steps.

1. Click **Save**.

  <img src="images/nsxt/import-cert-24-2.png" alt="Import the NSX Manager CA certificate to the NSX Manager" width="475"> 

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For this use case, the <strong>Service Certificate</strong> option should be "No" (off) because you are using the certificate with NSX Manager appliance nodes. If you were using this certificate with a load balancer that fronts the NSX Manager nodes, you would enable this option.</p>

Add the certificate to each of the 3 NSX-T Managers. Once this is done, the same certificate is then replicated to the other NSX-T manager instances.

- Go to one of the NSX Managers in the NSX-T Managment Cluster.
- Select **System** > **Certificate**.
<img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-cluster/mgmt-cluster-55.png" alt="System > Certificate" width="525"> 
- Select **Import** > **Import Certificate**.
<img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-cluster/mgmt-cluster-56.png" alt="Import Certificate" width="525"> 
- Name: Enter a name for the certificate.
- Certificate Contents: Copy/paste the certitificate contents to this field.
- Priviate Key: Copy the private key to this field.
- Click **Save**.

<img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-cluster/mgmt-cluster-57.png" alt="Import Certificate" width="525"> 

##<a id='s5'></a> Step 5: Register the Cluster Certificate

Once you have imported the Cluster Certificate, register it with the NSX Management cluster using a cURL command against the Cluster Certificate API.

First, create environment variables for the VIP address and the certificate ID. In this example, `10.40.206.5` is the VIP address. The certificate ID is obtained from the NSX Manager UI where you imported the certificate.

```
export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=10.40.206.5

export CERTIFICATE_ID="63bb6646-052c-49df-b603-64d7e5bdb5bf"
```

Next, register the new NSX-T Manager CA cert using a cURL request to the Cluster Certificate API. Substitute `PASSWORD` with the password for NSX Manager.

```
curl --insecure -u admin:'PASSWORD' -X POST "https://$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS/api/v1/cluster/api-certificate?action=set_cluster_certificate&certificate_id=$CERTIFICATE_ID"
```

The certificate will be registered with the NSX Manager that the VIP address is associated with. 

To verify, using a browser go to the VIP address of the NSX Manager. Login and check that the new cert is used by the site (accessed using the VIP address). 

To further verify, SSH to each NSX Manager host and run the following two commands. All certificates returned should be the same.

```
get certificate api
get certificate cluster
```


Run the following set of command for **each** NSX-T manager instance. The CERTIFICATE_ID should be the same for all 3 NSX-T Manager instances. For example:

```
export NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS=10.40.206.2
export CERTIFICATE_ID="ea65ee14-d7d3-49c3-b656-ee0864282654"
```

```
curl --insecure -u admin:'VMware1!' -X POST "https://$NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS/api/v1/node/services/http?action=apply_certificate&certificate_id=$CERTIFICATE_ID"
```

##<a id='s6'></a> Step 6: Verify that the certificate is being used.

- Proceed to the site and enter username/password.
- Double check the new cert is used by the site.
- Check using SSH on the NSX-T mgr node: `nsx-manager-1> get certificate api`.
- Access NSX-T Manager using the NSX-T load balancer VIP (for example, `10.40.14.250`).
- Verify that this node is using the correct certificate.
