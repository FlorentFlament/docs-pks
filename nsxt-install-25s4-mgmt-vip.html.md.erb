This topic describes how to configure a Virtual IP address (VIP) for the NSX-T Management Cluster for <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed [all preceding NSX-T installation tasks](./nsxt-install-config-steps.html).

##<a id='nsxt-vip-about'></a> About the NSX Management Cluster VIP

The NSX-T Management Cluster comprises three NSX-T Manager nodes. To support a single access point for the NSX-T Manager user interface and API, assign a virtual IP Address (VIP) to the NSX-T Management Cluster. Once the VIP is assigned, any UI and API requests to NSX-T are redirected to the virtual IP address of the cluster, which is owned by the leader node. The leader node then routes the request forward to the other components of the appliance.

Using a VIP makes the NSX Management Cluster highly available. If you need to scale you can [provision a load balancer for the NSX-T Management Cluster](./nsxt-install-mgmt-lb.html). Provisioning a load balancer requires that NSX-T be fully installed and configured. It is recommended that you configure the VIP now, then install a load balancer after NSX-T is installed and configured, and only if needed. For more information about configuring a load balancer for the NSX-T Management Cluster, see [Provisioning a Load Balancer for the NSX-T Management Cluster](./nsxt-install-mgmt-lb.html).

## <a id="nsxt-vip-add"></a> Configure a VIP Address for the NSX-T Management Cluster

Complete the following instructions to create a VIP for the NSX Management Cluster. The IP address you use for the VIP must be part of the same subnet as the NSX-T Management nodes.

1. From your browser, log in with admin privileges to NSX Manager at `https://NSX-MANAGER-IP-ADDRESS`.
1. Go to **System > Overview**.
1. Click **Edit** next to the Virtual IP field.
1. Enter a VIP for the cluster, such as `172.16.11.81`. Ensure that the VIP is part of the same subnet as the other NSX Management nodes.
1. Click **Save**.
1. When prompted click **Refresh**.

## <a id="nsxt-vip-verify"></a> Verify the VIP Address

To verify the VIP and troubleshoot issues, complete the following steps.

1. From your browser, log in with admin privileges to the NSX-T Management Cluster using the VIP address `https://NSX-MANAGER-VIP-ADDRESS`.

1. To check the API leader of the management cluster, enter the following command in the NSX Manager CLI `get cluster status verbose`. See [Verify NSX VM Deployment for Enterprise PKS](./nsxt-install-verify-vm-deployment.html) for instructions on access the NSX-T Manager CLI.

1. To troubleshoot VIP issues, verify the following logs:
  * Reverse Proxy logs at `/var/log/proxy/reverse-proxy.log` 
  * Cluster manager logs at `/var/log/cbm/cbm.log`

## <a id="nsxt-vip-which"></a> Determine Which NSX-T Manager the VIP Is Assigned To

After the VIP is configured, you can still connect to any NSX-T manager using its own IP address, or use the VIP to connect to NSX-T Manager. Both methods work. However, the VIP is associated with a single NSX-T Manager. If that node goes down, the VIP attaches to another node. To determine which NSX-T Manager node the VIP is associated with, select the **Virtual IP** field in the NSX-T Manager UI.
