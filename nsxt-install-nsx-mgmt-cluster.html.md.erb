<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for installing additional NSX Manager nodes and forming the NSX Management Cluster for use with <%= vars.product_short %>.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed [all preceding NSX-T installation tasks](./nsxt-install-config-steps.html).

##<a id='nsx-mgr-cluster-about'></a> About the NSX-T Management Cluster

The NSX-T Management Cluster is a collection of three NSX Manager nodes for high-availability of the NSX Manager. For more information, see [Deploy NSX Manager Nodes to Form a Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-B89F5831-62E4-4841-BFE2-3F06542D5BF5.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

All the repository details and the password of the first deployed NSX Manager node are synchronized with the newly deployed NSX Manager nodes in the management cluster. After NSX-T is installed, create a Managment Cluster VIP or deploy a load balancer to front the NSX Management Cluster.

##<a id='login'></a> Log In to the NSX Manager Web UI

1. From your browser, log in with admin privileges to NSX Manager at `https://<nsx-manager-ip-address>` (for example, `https://10.16.176.10`).

1. For first time log ins, read and accept the EULA terms.

1. Select whether to join the VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and click **Save**.

1. View the "Welcome to NSX-T" screen. 
  - The screen indicates that you have 1 NSX Manager node installed, and that a "3 node cluster is recommended."
  - Before you can set up additional NSX Manager nodes, you need to add a compute manager.

##<a id='add-compute-mgr'></a> Add vCenter as the Compute Manager

Before you can add additional NSX Managers, the system prompts you to specify a Compute Manager. A compute manager is an application that manages resources such as hosts and VMs. We will use vCenter as the [Compute Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-D225CAFC-04D4-44A7-9A09-7C365AAFCA0E.html).

Complete the following steps to add vCenter as the Compute Manager.

1. In NSX Manager, select **System** > **Fabric** > **Compute Managers** > **Add**.

1. Configure the Compute Manager as follows:
  - **Name**: Enter the name to identify the vCenter Server.
  - **Description**: You can optionally describe any special details such as, the number of clusters in the vCenter Server.
  - **Domain Name/IP Address**: Enter the IP address of the vCenter Server.
  - **Type**: vCenter (keep the default option).
  - **Username** and **Password**: Enter the vCenter Server login credentials.
  - **Thumbprint**: Enter the vCenter Server SHA-256 thumbprint algorithm value. If you leave the thumbprint value blank, you are prompted to accept the server provided thumbprint. After you accept the thumbprint, it takes a few seconds for NSX-T Data Center to discover and register the vCenter Server resources.

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/nsx-mgmt-cluster/nsx-mgmt-cluster-05.png">  

1. Verify that the vCenter Compute Manager is successfully **Registered** and that its connection status is **Up**.

1. If the Compute Manager is not registered, troubleshoot as necessary. See [Add a Compute Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-D225CAFC-04D4-44A7-9A09-7C365AAFCA0E.html) for assistance.

##<a id='install-more-managers'></a> Deploy Additional NSX Manager Nodes

You can deploy additional NSX Manager nodes from the NSX user interface. For more information, see [Deploy Two Additional NSX Manager Nodes and Form a NSX Management Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-B89F5831-62E4-4841-BFE2-3F06542D5BF5.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

Complete the following procedure to deploy additional NSX Manager nodes and form the NSX-T Management Cluster. 

1. In NSX Manager, select **System** > **Overview** > **Add Nodes**.

1. Enter the NSX Manager common attribute details as follows:
  - Compute Manager: Registered resource compute manager is populated.
  - Enable SSH: Toggle the button to allow an SSH login to the new NSX Manager node.
  - Enable Root Access: Toggle the button to allow the root access to the new NSX Manager node.
  - CLI Username and Password Confirmation: The CLI username is set to admin. Enter the CLI password and password confirmation for the new nodes. The password must comply with the password strength restrictions.
  - Root Password and Password Confirmation: Set the root password and password confirmation for the new node. The password must comply with the password strength restrictions.
  - DNS Servers: Enter the DNS server IP address available in the vCenter Server.
  - NTP Servers: Enter the NTP server IP address.
  - Form Factor: Select **Medium** (default) or **Large**. Do not select **Small**.

1. Enter the NSX Manager node details.
  - Name: Enter a name for the NSX Manager node, such as `nsx-manager-2`.
  - Cluster: Designate the cluster the node is going to join from the drop-down menu.
  - Resource Pool or Host: Assign either a resource pool or a host for the node from the drop-down menu.
  - Datastore: Select a datastore for the node files from the drop-down menu.
  - Network: Assign the network from the drop-down menu.
  - Management IP/Netmask: Enter the IP address and netmask.
  - Management Gateway: Enter the gateway IP address.

1. Click **Add Node** and configure a third NSX Manager node.
  - Name: Enter a name for the NSX Manager node, such as `nsx-manager-3`.
  - Cluster: Designate the cluster the node is going to join from the drop-down menu.
  - Resource Pool or Host: Assign either a resource pool or a host for the node from the drop-down menu.
  - Datastore: Select a datastore for the node files from the drop-down menu.
  - Network: Assign the network from the drop-down menu.
  - Management IP/Netmask: Enter the IP address and netmask.

##<a id='verify-nsx-mgmt-cluster'></a> Verify the NSX Management Cluster

1. Verify the deployment of the new NSX Manager nodes.
  - At the **System** > **Overview** > **Management Cluster**, you should see the deployment of the additional nodes.
  - Wait for 10-15 minutes for the deployment, cluster formation, and repository synchronization to complete.
  - You can also track the deployment process on the **System** > **Overview** page for the vCenter Server.

1. See [Verify the Installation of Additional NSX Manager Nodes](./nsxt-install-verify-vm-deployment.html) to verify the installation of each additional node.
