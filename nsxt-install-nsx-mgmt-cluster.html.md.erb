<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for installing additional NSX Manager nodes and forming the NSX Management Cluster for use with <%= vars.product_short %>.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed [all preceding NSX-T installation tasks](./nsxt-install-config-steps.html).

##<a id='nsx-mgr-cluster-about'></a> About the NSX-T Management Cluster

The NSX-T Managment Cluster is a collection of three NSX Manager nodes. For more information, see [Deploy NSX Manager Nodes to Form a Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-B89F5831-62E4-4841-BFE2-3F06542D5BF5.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

Starting with NSX-T v2.4, the NSX Controller component is now part of the NSX Manager. Previously the NSX Manager was a singleton, and HA was achieved using multiple NSX Controllers. With NSX-T v2.4, since the standalone NSX Controller component is no longer used, to achieve HA you need to deploy multiple (three) NSX Managers.

All the repository details and the password of the first deployed NSX Manager node are synchronized with the newly deployed NSX Manager nodes in the managment cluster. After NSX-T is installed, you can create a Cluster VIP or deploy a load balancer to front the NSX Management Cluster.

##<a id='login'></a> Log In to the NSX Manager Web UI

1. [Log In to the Newly Created NSX Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-BF9FF9E2-47BD-466F-BDD2-8FF5145412E5.html) web interface.

    - From a browser, log in with admin privileges at the URL `https://NSX_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS`. 
    - For example, `https://10.16.176.10`. 

1. Read and accept the EULA terms.

1. Select whether to join the VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and click **Save**.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/nsx-mgmt-cluster/nsx-mgmt-cluster-02.png">  

1. View the "Welcome to NSX-T" screen. 

    - The screen indicates that you have 1 NSX Manager node installed, and that a "3 node cluster is recommended."
    - Before you can set up additional NSX Manager nodes, you need to add a compute manager.

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/nsx-mgmt-cluster/nsx-mgmt-cluster-03.png">  

##<a id='add-compute-mgr'></a> Add vCenter as the Compute Manager

Before you can add additional NSX Managers, the system prompts you to specify a Compute Manager. A compute manager is an application that manages resources such as hosts and VMs. We will use vCenter as the Compute Manager. For more information, see [Add a Compute Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-D225CAFC-04D4-44A7-9A09-7C365AAFCA0E.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

Complete the following steps to add vCenter as the Compute Manager.

1. From your browser, log in with admin privileges to an NSX Manager at `https://<nsx-manager-ip-address>`, if you are not already logged in.

1. Select **System** > **Fabric** > **Compute Managers** > **Add**.

1. Configure the Compute Manager as follows:

    - **Name**: Enter the name to identify the vCenter Server.
    - **Description**: You can optionally describe any special details such as, the number of clusters in the vCenter Server.
    - **Domain Name/IP Address**: Enter the IP address of the vCenter Server.
    - **Type**: vCenter (keep the default option).
    - **Username** and **Password**: Enter the vCenter Server login credentials.
    - **Thumbprint**: Enter the vCenter Server SHA-256 thumbprint algorithm value. If you leave the thumbprint value blank, you are prompted to accept the server provided thumbprint. After you accept the thumbprint, it takes a few seconds for NSX-T Data Center to discover and register the vCenter Server resources.

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/nsx-mgmt-cluster/nsx-mgmt-cluster-05.png">  

1. Verify that the vCenter Compute Manager is successfully **Registered** and that its connection status is **Up**.

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/nsx-mgmt-cluster/nsx-mgmt-cluster-06.png">  
    
1. If the Compute Manager is not registered, troubleshoot as necessary. Refer to the topic [Add a Compute Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-D225CAFC-04D4-44A7-9A09-7C365AAFCA0E.html) for guidance.

##<a id='install-more-managers'></a> Deploy Additional NSX Manager Nodes

You can deploy additional NSX Manager nodes from the NSX user interface. For more information, see [Deploy Two Additional NSX Manager Nodes and Form a NSX Management Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-B89F5831-62E4-4841-BFE2-3F06542D5BF5.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

Complete the following procedure to deploy additional NSX Manager nodes and form the NSX-T Management Cluster. 

1. From a browser, log in with admin privileges to an NSX Manager at https://<nsx-manager-ip-address>.

1. Select **System** > **Overview** > **Add Nodes**.

1. Enter the NSX Manager common attribute details as follows:

    - Compute Manager: Registered resource compute manager is populated.
    - Enable SSH: Toggle the button to allow an SSH login to the new NSX Manager node.
    - Enable Root Access: Toggle the button to allow the root access to the new NSX Manager node.
    - CLI Username and Password Confirmation: The CLI username is set to admin. Enter the CLI password and password confirmation for the new nodes. The password must comply with the password strength restrictions.

##<a id='verify-nsx-mgmt-cluster'></a> Verify the NSX Management Cluster

1. Verify the deployment of the new NSX Manager nodes.

    - At the **System** > **Overview** > **Management Cluster**, you should see the deployment of the additional nodes.
    - Wait for 10-15 minutes for the deployment, cluster formation, and repository synchronization to complete.
    - You can also track the deployment process on the **System** > **Overview** page for the vCenter Server.
