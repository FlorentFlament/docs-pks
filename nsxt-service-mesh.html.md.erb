This topic describes how to <%= vars.product_full %> with VMware Tanzu Service Mesh by VMware NSX (NSX-SM).

## <a id='about'></a> About VMware Tanzu Service Mesh by VMware NSX

VMware Tanzu Service Mesh by VMware NSX (NSX-SM) provides a service mesh solution for Kubernetes based on the NSX platform.
NSX-SM gives Kubernetes cluster users API-level visibility, control, and security over their clusters' services, data, and users. 

In a Kubernetes cluster, NSX-SM runs as a Pod and is deployed using a YAML file.

For more information, see [NSX Service Mesh on VMware Tanzu: CONNECT & PROTECT Applications Across Your Kubernetes Clusters and Clouds](https://blogs.vmware.com/networkvirtualization/2019/11/nsx-service-mesh-on-vmware-tanzu.html/) in the VMware _Network Virtualization_ blog.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

These instructions assume that:

* You have deployed <%= vars.product_full %> v1.7.0 or later.

* You have provisioned a target Kubernetes cluster for NSX-SM.

* You have an account with VMware Cloud Services.  If you do not already have an account, register as follows:
  1. Contact your Sales contact, or send an email to [driggs@vmware.com](mailto:driggs@vmware.com).
  1. Complete the registration process by following the emails you receive.

## <a id='install'></a> Install VMware Tanzu Service Mesh in a Cluster

Install VMware Tanzu Service Mesh by VMware NSX (NSX-SM) in a cluster as follows:

1. [Add the NSX-SM Service](#add-service)
1. [Onboard a Kubernetes Cluster to NSX-SM](#onboard)
1. [Install and Configure Istio](#istio)

### <a id='add-service'></a> Add the NSX-SM Service

1. Log in to the VMware Cloud Services console.

1. Select your organization or create a new one.

1. Select the NSX-SM service offering and add your account to the service.

### <a id='onboard-cluster'></a> Onboard a Kubernetes Cluster to NSX-SM

Complete the following steps to install NSX-SM onto a PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.

1. Sign in to the VMware Tanzu Service Mesh by VMware NSX console.

1. At upper-left, click **ADD NEW...** > **Onboard New Cluster...**.
  ![NSX-SM console](images/vsphere/nsx-sm-02-onboard-cluster.png)

1. At the **Onboard Clusters** screen, enter a name for NSX-SM to use to identify the target cluster.
  - It is recommended that you enter the name of the cluster used in PKS, but it can be a different name.
  - The cluster name must be unique within NSX-SM.

1. Click **GENERATE SECURITY TOKEN**

1. From the **Onboard Clusters** pane, click the copy icon to copy the `kubectl apply` command that applies the registration YAML file to the cluster.

1. Log in to your PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.

1. Apply the registration YAML to the cluster by running the `kubectl apply` command you copied. For example:
  `kubectl apply -f https://prod-1.servicemesh.biz/cluster-registration/k8s/v0.8.5/k8s-registration.yaml`

1. From the **Onboard Clusters** pane, click the copy icon to copy the `kubectl create secret` command that establishes a secure connection with NSX Service Mesh.

1. From your cluster, run the `kubectl create secret` command you copied.  For example
  `kubectl -n allspark create secret generic cluster-token --from-literal=token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxxxxxxxxxxx`

1. Click the green **INSTALL NSX SERVICE MESH** button to install NSX-SM on the cluster.
  ![NSX-SM Enter Cluster Name and Generate Token](images/vsphere/nsx-sm-05-install-sm-button.jpg)

1. The YAML file deploys a Pod to the target Kubernetes cluster that includes the NSX-SM agent.
  - If the target cluster is not discovered, click **EXIT AND RELOAD** and try again.

### <a id='istio'></a> Install and Configure Istio

Once the NSX-SM agent is correctly started on a cluster:

1. Return to the NSX-SM console and complete the on-boarding process by clicking on the **Install ISTIO** button in the on-boarding menu.
  - This operation installs the Istio components on the target cluster,
  including the Istio CNI plugin that lets Istio automatically inject its Envoy sidecar container whenever a new Pod is started.

After you have onboarded clusters to NSX-SM and installed Istio, they should appear in your NSX-SM console:

  ![NSX-SM console showing installed clusters](images/vsphere/nsx-sm-07-clusters-installed.png)

## <a id='issue'></a> Known Issue: Timeout

When the `pks delete cluster` command is issued, the system runs an errand to clean up the pods currently running in the cluster.
Istio installs a few pods that have a Pod Disruption Budget that conflict with the Enterprise PKS cleanup errand.
This means that the errand runs for a long time.

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.7 allows the user to select a timeout for Pod Disruption Budget, and the errand runs up to that timeout. Prior to v1.7, the timeout was very long (approximately 24 hours) and it looked like the deleting process was hanging forever.

**Workaround**

To avoid this problem, try to remove the on-boarded cluster as follows:

1. Log on to the NSX-SM console and click on the name of cluster you want to remove.

1. Near the top right corner click **REMOVE CLUSTER**.
  - If this operation is successful, you can safely delete the cluster with the `pks delete-cluster` command.
  - If the operation is not successful, run the following command on the cluster before attempting to delete it with `pks delete-cluster`:
    - `kubectl delete namespace istio-system`
