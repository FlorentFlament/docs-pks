This topic describes how to manage <%= vars.product_full %> after changing the password for infrastructure such as vSphere and NSX-T.  

## <a id='vcenter-pw-change'></a> Manage Your vCenter Password Configurations

If the vCenter password is changed after deploying <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere, perform the following operations:

1. Update the BOSH Director with the new vCenter password by following the steps in [Update the vCenter Password in the BOSH Director Tile](#bosh-pw-change-vc).
1. Update <%= vars.product_short %> with the new vCenter password by following the steps in [Update the vCenter Password in the the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile](#pks-pw-change-vc).
1. Deploy the new vCenter password by following the steps in [Deploy the vCenter Password to Enterprise PKS](#deploy-pks').

1. Select the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
1. Select the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** tab.

### <a id='deploy-pks'></a> Step 3: Deploy the vCenter Password to <%= vars.product_short %>

After changing the IaaS infrastructure password in Ops Manager the new password must be deployed to <%= vars.product_short %>. 
Because the password is stored in Kubernetes clusters (for the Kubernetes cloud provider), 
you must apply the tile changes with the cluster upgrade errand enabled.  

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. In the **Errands** section for <%= vars.product_short %>, select **Update all clusters errand**. 
1. Click **Apply Changes** to update the installation of <%= vars.product_short %>.

## <a id='vcenter-pw-change'></a> NSX Manager Password Change

If the NSX Manager password is changed after deploying <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere, perform the following steps:

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
1. Edit the BOSH Director tile.
1. Select the **vCenter Config** tab.
1. Click the **Change** link beneath the **NSX Username** field.
1. Enter the new password and click **Save**.
