title: Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements
owner: PKS
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the firewall ports and protocols requirements for using Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

In environments with strict inter-network access control policies, firewalls often require conduits to pass communication between system components on a different network or allow interfacing with external systems such as with enterprise applications or the public Internet. 

For PKS, we recommend that you disable security policies that filter traffic between the networks
supporting the system. When that is not an option, refer to the following table, which identifies
the flows between system components in a typical PKS deployment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must set the communication path in your firewall settings to accomodate how you elect to control what groups have access to deploy and scale PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters in your organization. In this case, mirror the settings on the lines below for the Operator â€“> PKS API server.</p>

You have the option to expose containerized applications, running in a Kubernetes cluster, for
external consumption through various ports and methods.

You can enable external access to applications by way of NSX and non-NSX load balancers and
ingress. Enabling access to applications through standard Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress
controller types allow for specific port and protocol designations, while the NAT function offered
through NSX-T will allow external addresses and ports to be automatically mapped and resolved to
internal/local addresses and ports.

The NodePort Service type is not supported for PKS deployments on vSphere with NSX-T. Only
`type:LoadBalancer` and Services associated with Ingress rules are supported on vSphere
with NSX-T.
