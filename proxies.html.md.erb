title: Using Proxies with Enterprise PKS on NSX-T

This topic describes how to use proxies with <%= vars.product_full %> with NSX-T.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

If your environment includes HTTP proxies, you can configure <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T to use these proxies so that <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes master and worker nodes access public Internet services and other internal services through a proxy.

In addition, <%= vars.product_short %> proxy settings apply to the PKS API instance.
When an <%= vars.product_short %> operator creates a Kubernetes cluster, the PKS API instance VM behind a proxy is able to manage NSX-T objects on the standard network.

You can also proxy outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director so that all <%= vars.product_short %> components use the same proxy service.

The following diagram illustrates the network architecture:

## <a id='pks-nsxt-proxy'></a>Enable PKS API and Kubernetes Proxy

To configure a global HTTP proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the Kubernetes cluster nodes and the PKS API server, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Click the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**. When this option is enabled, you can proxy HTTP traffic, HTTPS traffic, or both.  
<%= partial 'global-proxy' %>
1. Save the changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

1. Proceed with any remaining <%= vars.product_tile %> tile configurations and deploy <%= vars.product_short %>. See <a href="./installing-nsx-t.html">Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

## <a id='pks-om-bosh-proxy'></a>Enable Ops Manager and BOSH Proxy

To enable an HTTP proxy for outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. Select **User Name > Settings** in the upper right.

1. Click **Proxy Settings**.

1. Under **HTTP Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTP proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:80`.

1. Under **HTTPS Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:80`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using an HTTPS connection to the proxy server is not supported. Ops Manager and BOSH HTTP and HTTPS proxy options can be only configured with an HTTP connection to the proxy.</p>

1. Under **No Proxy**, include the hosts that must bypass the proxy. This is required.
	<br><br>
	In addition to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, include the BOSH Director IP, Ops Manager IP, PKS API VM IP, and the PKS Database VM IP.
	If the PKS database is in HA mode, enter all your database IPs in the **No Proxy** field.

	```
	127.0.0.1,localhost,BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP,PKS-API-IP,OPS-MANAGER-IP,PKS-DATABASE-IP
	```

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager does not allow the use of a CIDR range in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field. You must specify each individual IP address to bypass the proxy.<br><br>
	The <strong>No Proxy</strong> field does not accept wildcard domain notation, such as <code>*.docker.io</code> and <code>*.docker.com</code>. You must specify the exact IP or FQDN to bypass the proxy, such as <code>registry-1.docker.io</code>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy Ops Manager and the BOSH Director with the updated proxy settings.
