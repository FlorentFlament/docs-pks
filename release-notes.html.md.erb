###<a id='1-7-0-known-issues'></a> Known Issues

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.7.0 has the following known issues.

#### <a id="1-7-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login  

**Symptom**  

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.  

**Explanation**  

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum 
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should 
be resized to 50,000.  

**Workaround**  

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size` 
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters. 
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes, 
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.  

#### <a id='1-7-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs  

**Symptom**  

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.  

**Explanation**  

In <%= vars.product_short %>, each plan has a unique plan ID. 
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. 
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.  

**Solution**  

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**. 
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.  

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.  

#### <a id='1-7-0-eight-cores-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node Configuration  

**Symptom**  

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size, 
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error: 
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... no of cpu cores is less than 8_". 

**Explanation**  

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is erroneously returning the "_cpu cores is less than 8_" error.

**Solution**  

You can safely configure your NSX-T Edge Node VMs as `medium` size and ignore the error.
