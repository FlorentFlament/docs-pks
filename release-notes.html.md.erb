<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> NSX-T v2.4 implements a new user interface (UI) based on the NSX Policy API. 
PKS v1.4.0 does not support the NSX Policy API. Any objects created via the new Policy-based UI cannot be used with PKS v1.4.0.
If you are installing PKS v1.4.0 with NSX-T v2.4.x, or upgrading to PKS v1.4.0 and NSX-T 2.4.x, 
you must use the "Advanced Networking" tab in NSX Manager to create, read, update, and delete 
all networking objects required for PKS.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager v2.5.0 and later in the
v2.5 version line and Ops Manager v2.4.4 and later in the v2.4 version line
do not support PKS v1.4 on Azure.
Before deploying PKS v1.4 on Azure, you must install Ops Manager v2.4.2
or v2.4.3.</p>

### <a id='vsphere-reqs'></a> vSphere Version Requirements

For <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere or vSphere with NSX&#8209;T installatios, Ops Manager and <%= vars.product_short %> support the following vSphere component versions:

### <a id="v1.4.0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade path to PKS v1.4.0 is from PKS v1.3.6. No other upgrade paths are supported.

To upgrade, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>](upgrade-pks.html) and [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

### <a id="v1.4.0-whats-new"></a>What's New

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.0 adds the following:

* Operators can configure up to ten sets of resource types, or _plans_, in the PKS tile. All
plans except the first can made available or unavailable to developers deploying clusters. Plan 1
must be configured and made available as a default for developers. For more information, see the
_Plans_ section of the Installing <%= vars.product_short %> documentation for your IaaS.

* Operators can install PKS and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on the same instance of Ops
Manager.

* Improved workflow for managing cluster access. For more information, see [Grant Cluster Access](manage-users.html#cluster-access) in _Managing Users in <%= vars.product_short %> with UAA_.

* Operators can create webhook ClusterSink resources. A webhook ClusterSink resource batches logs into 1 second units, wraps the resulting payload in JSON, and uses the POST method to deliver the logs to the address of your log management service. For more information see, [Create a Webhook ClusterSink Resource with YAML and kubectl](create-sinks.html#webhook-cluster-sink) in _Creating Sinks_.

* Operators can set quotas for maximum memory and CPU utilization in a PKS deployment. For more information, see the _PKS API_ section of the Installing Enterprise PKS documentation for your IaaS. This is a beta feature.

    <%= partial 'beta-component' %>

* Operators can enable the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin on a per-plan basis requiring cluster users to have policy, role, and role binding permissions to deploy pod workloads. See [Pod Security Policies](./pod-security-policy.html) for more information.

* Operators can enable the SecurityContextDeny admission plugin on a per-plan basis to prohibit the use of security context configurations on pods and containers. See [Security Context Deny](./security-context-deny.html) for more information.

* Operators can enable the DenyEscalatingExec admission plugin on a per-plan basis to prohibit the use of certain commands for containers that allow host access. See [Deny Escalating Execution](./deny-escalating-execution.html) for more information.

* Operators can use HostGroups to define Availability Zones (AZs) for clusters in BOSH. See [Using vSphere Host Groups](./vsphere-host-group.html).

* Operators can deploy up to 5 master nodes per plan. See Configuring Plans for your IaaS, such as [vSphere with NSX-T](./installing-nsx-t.html#plans).

* Operators can update a Network Profile and add to or reorder the **Pods IP Block** IDs. See [Update Network Profile](./network-profiles.html#update-profile).

### <a id="v1.4.0-known-issues"></a>Breaking Changes and Known Issues

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a name="security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4, the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

#### <a id='first-az'></a>PKS Selects the First AZ Only During Cluster Creation

**Symptom**

If the first availability zone (AZ) used by a plan with multiple AZs runs out of
resources, cluster creation fails with an error like the following:

<pre class="terminal">
L Error: CPI error 'Bosh::Clouds::CloudError' with message 'No valid placement found for requested memory: 4096
</pre>

**Explanation**

BOSH creates VMs for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment using a round-robin
algorithm. BOSH tries to create the first VM in the first AZ that your plan uses.
If the first AZ runs out of resources, cluster creation fails and BOSH does not try
to create more VMs.
