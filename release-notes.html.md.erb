## <a id="v1.5.0"></a>v1.5.0

**Release Date**: August 20, 2019

### <a id="v1.5.0-features"></a>Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Cluster administrators can use the `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME --details` command to view details about an individual cluster,
including Kubernetes nodes and NSX-T network details. For more information, see [Viewing Cluster Details](./view-cluster-details.html).
* <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 adds the following network profiles:
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to use a single, shared Tier-1 router per Kubernetes cluster.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profiles for Shared Tier-1 Router](./network-profiles-shared-t1.html).
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to use a third-party load balancer for Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer`.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profiles for the Layer 4 Load Balancer](./network-profiles-ncp-lb.html).
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to use a third-party ingress controller for pod ingress traffic.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profile for the HTTP/S Ingress Controller](./network-profiles-ncp-ingress.html).
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to configure section markers for explicit distributed firewall rule placement.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profile for Distributed Firewall Section Marking](./network-profiles-ncp-dfw.html).
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to configure NCP logging.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profiles for NCP Logging](./network-profiles-ncp-logerr.html).
  * Cluster administrators can define a network profile to configure DNS lookup of the IP addresses for the Kubernetes API load balancer and ingress controller.
  For more information, see [Defining Network Profile for DNS Lookup of Pre-Provisioned IP Addresses](./network-profiles-dns.html).
* Cluster administrators can provision Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters on vSphere with Flannel.
Windows worker-based clusters in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 do not support NSX-T integration.
For more information, see [Configuring Windows Worker-Based Clusters (Beta)](windows-pks-beta.html)
and [Deploying and Exposing Windows Workloads (Beta)](deploy-windows-workloads-beta.html).
* Operators can set the lifetime for the refresh and access tokens for Kubernetes clusters.
You can configure the token lifetimes to meet your organization's security and compliance needs.
For information about configuring the access and refresh token for your Kubernetes clusters,
see the [UAA](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#uaa) section in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
* Operators can configure prefixes for OpenID Connect (OIDC) users
and groups to avoid name conflicts with existing Kubernetes system users.
Pivotal recommends adding prefixes to ensure OIDC users and groups
do not gain unintended privileges on clusters. For information about configuring OIDC prefixes,
see the [Configure OpenID Connect](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#configure-oidc) section
in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
* Operators can configure an external SAML identity provider for user authentication and authorization.
For information about configuring an external SAML identity provider,
see the [Configure SAML as an Identity Provider](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#configure-saml)
section in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
* Operators can upgrade Kubernetes clusters separately from the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
For information about upgrading Kubernetes clusters, see [Upgrading Clusters](./upgrade-clusters.html).
* Operators can configure the Telegraf agent to send master/etcd node metrics
to a third-party monitoring service. For more information,
see [Monitoring Master/etcd Node VMs](./monitor-etcd.html).
* Operators can configure the default node drain behavior.
You can use this feature to resolve hanging or failed cluster upgrades.
For more information about configuring node drain behavior,
see [Worker Node Hangs Indefinitely](./troubleshoot-issues.html#upgrade-drain-hangs) in _Troubleshooting_
and [Configure Node Drain Behavior](./checklist.html#configure-node-drain)
in Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.
* App developers can create metric sinks for namespaces within a Kubernetes cluster.
For more information, see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).
* VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and the Pivotal Telemetry Program (Telemetry)
are now enabled in <%= vars.product_short %> by default.
This includes both new installations and upgrades.
For information about configuring CEIP and Telemetry in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile,
see the [CEIP and Telemetry](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#telemetry) section in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
* Adds a beta release of VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console
that provides a graphical interface for deploying and managing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere.

### <a id='vsphere-reqs'></a> vSphere Version Requirements

For <%= vars.product_short %> installations on vSphere or on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center, refer to the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&356=&175=&1=">VMware Product Interoperability Matrices</a>.</p>

### <a id="v1.5.0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.0 and later.

**Exception:** If you are running <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.0 with NSX-T v2.3.x, follow the steps below:

1. Upgrade to PKS v1.4.1.
1. Upgrade to NSX-T v2.4.1.
1. Upgrade to PKS v1.5.0.

For more information, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>](upgrade-pks.html) and [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

### <a id="v1.5.0-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 has the following breaking changes:

#### <a id='nsxt-242'></a> Announcing Support for NSX-T v2.4.2 with a Known Issue and Workaround

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.5 supports NSX-T v2.4.2. However, there is a known issue with NSX-T v2.4.2 that can affect new and upgraded 
installations of <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5 that use a [NAT topology](./nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat). 

For NSX-T v2.4.2, the PKS Management Plane must be deployed on a Tier-1 distributed router (DR).
If the PKS Management Plane is deployed on a Tier-1 service router (SR), the router needs to be converted.
To convert an SR to a DR, refer to the [East-West traffic between workloads behind different T1 is impacted, when NAT is configured on T0 (71363)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/71363) KB article.

This issue will be addressed in a subsequent release of NSX-T such that it will not matter if the Tier-1 Router is a DR or an SR.

#### <a id='oidc'></a> New OIDC Prefixes Break Existing Cluster Role Bindings

In <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5, operators can configure prefixes for OIDC usernames and groups.
If you add OIDC prefixes you must manually change any existing role bindings that bind to a username or group.
If you do not change your role bindings, developers cannot access Kubernetes clusters.
For information about creating a role binding, see [Managing Cluster Access and Permissions](./manage-cluster-permissions.html).

#### <a id='sink-api-changes'></a> New API Group Name for Sink Resources

The `apps.pivotal.io` API group name for sink resources is no longer supported.
The new API group name is `pksapi.io`.

When creating a sink resource,
your sink resource YAML definition must start with `apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1`.
All existing sinks are migrated automatically.

For more information about defining and managing sink resources, see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).

#### <a id='log-sink-changes'></a> Log Sink Changes

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 adds the following log sink changes:

* The `ClusterSink` log sink resource has been renamed to `ClusterLogSink` and the `Sink` log sink resource has been renamed to `LogSink`.

    * When you create a log sink resource with YAML, you must use one of the new names in your sink resource YAML definition. For example, specify `kind: ClusterLogSink` to define a cluster log sink. All existing sinks are migrated automatically.

    * When managing your log sink resources through kubectl, you must use the new log sink resource names.
    For example, if you want to delete a cluster log sink, run `kubectl delete clusterlogsink` instead of `kubectl delete clustersink`.

* Log transport now requires a secure connection. When creating a `ClusterLogSink` or `LogSink` resource,
you must include `enable_tls: true` in your sink resource YAML definition.
All existing sinks are migrated automatically.

For more information about defining and managing sink resources, see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).

#### <a id='sink-cli-deprecation'></a> Deprecation of Sink Commands in the PKS CLI

The following <%= vars.product_short %> Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) commands are deprecated
and will be removed in a future release:

* `pks create-sink`
* `pks sinks`
* `pks delete-sink`

You can use the following Kubernetes CLI commands instead:

* `kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml`
* `kubectl get clusterlogsinks`
* `kubectl delete clusterlogsink YOUR-SINK`

For more information about defining and managing sink resources,
see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).

### <a id="v1.5.0-known-issues"></a> Known Issues

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id='ingress-allocation'></a> Duplicate IP address conflict can occur 

When a network profile is used to provision a Kubernetes cluster and perform a [DNS lookup of the ingress controller IP address](./network-profiles-dns.html), NCP allocates the IP address from the floating IP pool, but in NSX-T the IP address is not marked as allocated. As a result, NCP can re-allocate the IP same address for another purpose in which case a duplicate IP conflict will occur.

This known issue does not affect allocation of the IP address for the Kubernetes API server load balancer.

#### <a id='no-password-om'></a> Passwords Not Supported for Ops Manager VM on vSphere

Starting in Ops Manager v2.6, you can SSH into the Ops Manager VM in a vSphere deployment only with a private SSH key.
You cannot SSH into the Ops Manager VM with a password.

To avoid upgrade failure and errors when authenticating, add a public key to the **Customize Template** screen of the OVF template for the Ops Manager VM.
Then, use the private key to SSH into the Ops Manager VM.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You cannot upgrade to Ops Manager v2.6 successfully without adding a public key. If you do not add a key, Ops Manager shuts down automatically because it cannot find a key and may enter a reboot loop.</p>

For more information about adding a public key to the OVF template, see [Deploy Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/om/vsphere/deploy.html#deploy) in _Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere_.

#### <a id="security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

#### <a id='first-az'></a>Cluster Creation Fails When First AZ Runs Out of Resources

**Symptom**

If the first availability zone (AZ) used by a plan with multiple AZs runs out of
resources, cluster creation fails with an error like the following:

<pre class="terminal">
L Error: CPI error 'Bosh::Clouds::CloudError' with message 'No valid placement found for requested memory: 4096
</pre>

**Explanation**

BOSH creates VMs for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment using a round-robin
algorithm, creating the first VM in the first AZ that your plan uses.
If the AZ runs out of resources, cluster creation fails because BOSH cannot create
the cluster VM.

For example, if you have three AZs and you
create two clusters with four worker VMs each, BOSH deploys VMs in the
following AZs:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>AZ1</th>
    <th>AZ2</th>
    <th>AZ3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cluster 1</th>
    <td>Worker VM 1</td>
    <td>Worker VM 2</td>
    <td>Worker VM 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Worker VM 4</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cluster 2</th>
    <td>Worker VM 1</td>
    <td>Worker VM 2</td>
    <td>Worker VM 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Worker VM 4</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
</table>

In this scenario, AZ1 has twice as many VMs as AZ2 or AZ3.

#### <a id='azure-worker-comm'></a>Azure Worker Node Communication Fails after Upgrade

**Symptom**

Outbound communication from a worker node VM fails after upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>.

**Explanation**

<%= vars.product_short %> uses Azure Availability Sets to improve the uptime of workloads and worker nodes in the event of Azure platform failures. Worker node
VMs are distributed evenly across Availability Sets.

Azure Standard SKU Load Balancers are recommended for the Kubernetes control plane and Kubernetes ingress and egress. This load balancer type provides an IP address for outbound communication using SNAT.

During an upgrade, when BOSH rebuilds a given worker instance in an Availability Set,
Azure can time out while re-attaching the worker node network interface to the
back-end pool of the Standard SKU Load Balancer.

For more information, see [Outbound connections in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections) in the Azure documentation.

**Workaround**

You can manually re-attach the worker instance to the back-end pool of the Azure Standard SKU Load Balancer in your Azure console.

#### <a id='timeout'></a> Error During Individual Cluster Upgrades

**Symptom**

While submitting a large number of cluster upgrade requests using the `pks upgrade-cluster` command, some of your Kubernetes clusters are marked as failed.

**Explanation**

BOSH upgrades Kubernetes clusters in parallel with a limit of up to four concurrent cluster upgrades by default.
If you schedule more than four cluster upgrades,
<%= vars.product_short %> queues the upgrades and waits for BOSH to finish the last upgrade.
When BOSH finishes the last upgrade, it starts working on the next upgrade request.

If you submit too many cluster upgrades to BOSH, an error may occur,
where some of your clusters are marked as `FAILED` because BOSH can start the upgrade only within the specified timeout.
The timeout is set to 168 hours by default.
However, BOSH does not remove the task from the queue or stop working on the upgrade if it has been picked up.

**Solution**

If you expect that upgrading all of your Kubernetes clusters takes more than 168 hours,
do not use a script that submits upgrade requests for all of your clusters at once.
For information about upgrading Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.product_short %>,
see [Upgrading Clusters](./upgrade-clusters.html).

#### <a id="kubectl-azs"></a> Kubectl CLI Commands Do Not Work after Changing an Existing Plan to a Different AZ

**Symptom**

After you update the AZ of an existing plan, kubectl CLI commands do not work for your clusters associated with the plan.

**Explanation**

This issue occurs in IaaS environments that do not support attaching a disk across multiple AZs.

When the plan of an existing cluster changes to a different AZ,
BOSH migrates the cluster by creating VMs for the cluster in the new AZ and
removing your cluster VMs from the original AZ.

On an IaaS that does not support attaching VM disks across AZs,
the disks BOSH attaches to the new VMs do not have the original content.

**Workaround**

If you cannot run kubectl CLI commands after reconfiguring the AZ of an existing cluster, contact Support for assistance.

#### <a name='telemetry-settings'></a> Internal Server Error When Saving Telemetry Settings

**Symptom**

When saving the **Telemetry** configuration pane in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, you receive an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`.

**Explanation**

When using Ops Manager v2.5, you may receive an `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` if you attempt to
save Telemetry preferences without configuring all of the required settings in the pane.

**Solution**

In your browser, return to the **Telemetry** pane.
Configure all of the required settings and click **Save**.

#### <a name='uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Is Longer Than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.product_short %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id="metricsink"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Metric Sinks Fail to Use Secure Connections

**Symptom**

When you attempt to use `MetricSink` or `ClusterMetricSink` over a secure connection, the TLS handshake is rejected by Telegraf.

**Explanation**

This is due to missing CA certificates in the Telegraf container images included in the tile version.
A patch is being worked on. Until this patch is published, users are not able to send metrics through secure connections.

#### <a id="kubectl-azure-avail"></a> Kubelet Fails to Start When Creating Clusters on Azure

**Symptom**

kubelet fails to start when creating new clusters on Azure.  

**Explanation**

This issue occurs on Azure after enabling Availability Sets on a new <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5 installation.  

### <a id="v1.5.0-known-issues--mgmt-console"></a> Enterprise PKS Management Console Known Issues

The following known issues are specific to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v0.9.0 appliance and user interface.

#### <a id="console-notifications"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Notifications Persist

**Symptom**

In the **Enterprise PKS** view of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, error notifications sometimes persist in memory on the  **Clusters** and **Nodes** pages after you clear those notifications. 

**Explanation**

After clicking the **X** button to clear a notification it is removed, but when you navigate back to those pages the notification might show again.

**Workaround**

Use shift+refresh to reload the page. 

#### <a id="console-delete"></a>Cannot Delete <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment from Management Console 

**Symptom**

In the **Enterprise PKS** view of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, you cannot use the **Delete Enterprise PKS Deployment** option even after you have removed all clusters. 

**Explanation**

The option to delete the deployment is only activated in the management console a short period after the clusters are deleted.

**Workaround**

After removing clusters, wait for a few minutes before attempting to use the **Delete Enterprise PKS Deployment** option again. 

#### <a id="console-vli-port"></a>Configuring <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Integration with VMware vRealize Log Insight

**Symptom**

Enterprise PKS Management Console appliance sends logs to VMware vRealize Log Insight over HTTP, not HTTPS.

**Explanation**

When you deploy the Enterprise PKS Management Console appliance from the OVA, if you require log forwarding to vRealize Log Insight, you must provide the port on the vRealize Log Insight server on which it listens for HTTP traffic. Do not provide the HTTPS port.

**Workaround**

Set the vRealize Log Insight port to the HTTP port. This is typically 9000.

#### <a id="console-nsxt-flannel-error"></a>Deploying <%= vars.product_short %> to an Unprepared NSX-T Data Center Environment Results in Flannel Error

**Symptom**

When using the management console to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> in **NSX-T Data Center (Not prepared for PKS)** mode, if an error occurs during the network configuration, the message `Unable to set flannel environment` is displayed in the deployment progress page.  

**Explanation**

The network configuration has failed, but the error message is incorrect.

**Workaround**

To see the correct reason for the failure, see the server logs. For instructions about how to obtain the server logs, see [Troubleshooting Enterprise PKS Management Console](./console/console-troubleshooting.html). 

#### <a id="console-bosh-cli"></a>Using BOSH CLI from Operations Manager VM 

**Symptom**

The BOSH CLI client bash command that you obtain from the **Deployment Metadata** view does not work when logged in to the Operations Manager VM.

**Explanation**

The BOSH CLI client bash command from the **Deployment Metadata** view is intended to be used from within the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance.

**Workaround**

To use the BOSH CLI from within the Operations Manager VM, see [Connect to Operations Manager](./console/console-login-opsmanager.html).

From the Ops Manager VM, use the BOSH CLI client bash command from the **Deployment Metadata** page, with the following modifications:

 * Remove the clause `BOSH_ALL_PROXY=xxx`
 * Replace the `BOSH_CA_CERT` section with `BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate` 

#### <a id="console-pks-cli"></a>Run `pks` Commands against the PKS API Server

**Explanation**

The PKS CLI is available in the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance. 

**Workaround**

To be able to run `pks` commands against the PKS API Server, you must first log to PKS using the following command syntax `pks login -a fqdn_of_pks …`.

To do this, you must ensure either of the following:

 * The FQDN configured for the PKS Server is resolvable by the DNS server configured for the Enterprise PKS Management Console appliance, or
 * An entry that maps the Floating IP assigned to the PKS Server to the FQDN exists on /etc/hosts in the appliance. For example: `192.168.160.102 api.pks.local`.
