## <a id='1-6-0'></a>v1.6.0

**Release Date**: November 14, 2019

### <a id='1-6-0-features'></a>Features

New features and changes in this release:

* [BETA 2] Bumps UAA to v73.4.8.
* [BETA 1] Bumps Kubernetes to v1.15.4.
* [BETA 1] Adds a new UAA scope, `pks.clusters.audit_readonly`, for <%= vars.product_short %> users.
For information about UAA scopes,
see [UAA Scopes for <%= vars.product_short %> Users](uaa-scopes.html) and [Managing <%= vars.product_short %> Users with UAA](manage-users.html).
* Adds support for floating Windows stemcells on vSphere.
* [BETA 1] Provides granular upgrade that supports batch operation with canary, max-in-flight option, enabling you to upgrade multiple clusters at the same time.
For information about Kubernetes clusters with Windows workers in <%= vars.product_short %>,
see [Configuring Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Clusters (Beta)](windows-pks-beta.html).
* [BETA 1] Enable force deletion function for clusters, eliminating the need to use bosh delete deployment function to cleanup failed cluster deletions.
* Enables operators to configure the location of the Windows pause image. 
For information about configuring **Kubelet customization - Windows pause image location**, see 
[Plans](windows-pks-beta.html#plans) in _Configuring Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Clusters (Beta)_.  
* Adds support for Fluent Bit output plugins to `ClusterLogSink` and `LogSink` resources.
For information about configuring Fluent Bit output plugins, see [Create a ClusterLogSink or LogSink Resource with a Fluent Bit Output Plugin](create-sinks.html#fluentbit-output-plugin)
in _Creating Sink Resources_.
* Updates the **Worker VM Max in Flight** default value from `1` to `5`, 
accelerating cluster creation and cluster upgrades by allowing up to five new nodes to be provisioned simultaneously.
The updated default value is applied during new <%= vars.product_short %> installation 
and is not applied during an <%= vars.product_short %> upgrade. 
If you are upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> from a previous version and want to enable multi-cluster provisioning, 
see [Configure Worker VM Max in Flight](checklist.html#configure-psp-bindings) 
in the _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6_ topic.  
* [BETA 1] Enables operators to limit the total number of clusters a user can provision in <%= vars.product_short %>.
For more information about quotas, see [Managing Resource Usage with Quotas](resource-usage.html) and [Viewing Usage Quotas](resource-review.html).
* Removes the `pks create-sink`, `pks sinks`, and `pks delete-sink` PKS CLI commands.
You can use the following commands instead:
  * `kubectl apply -f YOUR-SINK.yml`
  * `kubectl get clusterlogsinks`
  * `kubectl delete clusterlogsink YOUR-SINK`
* Enables operators to upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters simultaneously and 
to designate specific upgrade clusters as canary clusters. 
For more information about multiple cluster upgrades, see 
[Upgrade Clusters](upgrade-clusters.html#upgrade-clusters) in _Upgrading Clusters_.  
* Enables operators to configure a single Kubernetes cluster with a specific Docker 
Registry CA certificate. For more information about configuring a cluster with a Docker 
Registry CA certificate, see [Configuring PKS Clusters with Private Docker Registry CA Certificates]
(docker-custom-ca-certs.html).
* [BETA 2] Enables administrators to name the Enterprise PKS installation in the Telemtry report.
* [BETA 2] Provides new monitoring capabilities for administrators and operators. See [Viewing Usage Data](./view-usage-data.html) and [Monitoring Enterprise PKS with Log Sinks](./monitor-sinks.html) for more information.
