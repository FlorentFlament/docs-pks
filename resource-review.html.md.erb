<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to review your VM resource usage and quotas using the Pivotal Container Service Application Interface (PKS API).  

Your <%= vars.product_short %> administrator might set a maximum resource utilization limit on the VM instances you create. 
The administrator can restrict total VM memory size and CPU count. 

This quota limitation is based on the total allocated size of the VM instances 
you create, not their actual utilization. 

Using PKS API you can determine the size limitations your administrator has assigned to you and your 
current usage.

    curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer USER-TOKEN" https://localhost:9021/HOSTNAME/quotas/USER-ID
    ```

    Where:
    * `USER-TOKEN` is your authentication token.
    * `HOSTNAME` is your API Hostname.
    * `USER-ID` is your user account id.
