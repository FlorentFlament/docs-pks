This topic explains how to scale an existing cluster by using the PKS CLI to increase or decrease
the number of worker nodes in the cluster.

## <a id="scale-add-nodes"></a>Scale Horizontally by Adding Worker Nodes

Follow the steps below to scale an existing cluster using the PKS CLI by increasing or decreasing the number of worker nodes in the cluster.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. To view the current number of worker nodes in your cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    pks resize CLUSTER-NAME --num-nodes NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    * `NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES` is the number of worker nodes you want to set for the cluster.
	   * To scale down your existing cluster, enter a number lower than the current number of worker
        nodes. 
		* To scale up your existing cluster, enter a number higher than the current number of worker
        nodes. The maximum number of worker nodes you can set is configured in the **Plan** pane of
        the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile in Pivotal Ops Manager.

	 For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ pks resize my-cluster --num-nodes 5
    </pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This command may roll additional virtual machines in the
    cluster, which can affect workloads if the worker nodes are at capacity.</p>

## <a id="scale-resize-vms"></a>Scale Vertically by Resizing Kubernetes Node VM Sizes

You can scale an existing cluster vertically by changing the size of the master or worker node VMs. When this is done, BOSH will recreate the VMs sequentially, one cluster by another, and one node after another within the cluster.

To do this:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.
1. Select the PKS tile.
1. Select the plan that is in use by the cluster you want to resize.
1. For the Master VM size, change the selected VM (if you want to change the size of the Master node).
1. For the Worker VM size, change the select VM (if you want to change the size of the Worker node).
1. Save the tile changes.
1. Click Review Changes.
1. Verify that the "Update all clusters errand" is selected. You must ensure that this errand is selected so that the manifest is regenerated after the plan is updated.
