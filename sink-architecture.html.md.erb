title: Sink Architecture in Enterprise PKS

This topic describes how sinks are implemented in <%= vars.product_full %> deployments.
## <a id="overview"></a> Overview
Your deployment's applications and services record activity and issues within log files. 
Additionally, your deployment's applications may collect metrics on you deployment's health.  

<%= vars.product_short %>  provides two collection and aggregation sinks for managing your deployment's logs and collected metrics:

* A [Log Sink](#sink-architecture) for monitoring your environment's logs.  
* A [ClusterMetric Sink](#clustermetric-sink-architecture) for monitoring your environment's metrics.  

## <a id="sink-architecture"></a> Log Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.product_short %> Log Sink aggregates your deployment's logs and forwards them to a common repository.

Logs are monitored and aggregated by a set of fluent-bit daemons, which run as a pod on a single node. 

An event-controller collects Kubernetes API events and sends them to a second fluent-bit daemons pod for aggregation.

All aggregated log entries are marshaled to a common log destination.

The following diagram details <%= vars.product_short %> Log Sink architecture.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sinks are added or removed, all of the fluent-bit pods are refreshed with new sink information.</p>

## <a id="clustermetric-sink-architecture"></a> ClusterMetric Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.product_short %> ClusterMetric Sink aggregates your deployment's collected metrics.

Metrics are monitored by a set of third-party plugins. The plugins forward the metrics to a Telegraph service running as a pod on a node.

The Telegraph service collects, processes, and aggregates the gathered metrics. 

A metric-controller monitors kubernetes metrics and forwards those to a second Telegraph service for collection, processing, and aggregation.

All aggregated metrics are marshaled to an additional plug-in for forwarding to a third-party application.

The following diagram details <%= vars.product_short %> ClusterMetric Sink architecture.
