title: Sink Architecture in Enterprise PKS
owner: PKS

This topic describes how sinks are implemented in <%= vars.product_full %> workloads.
## <a id="overview"></a> Overview
<%= vars.product_short %>  provides the following types of sinks for collecting logs and metrics:

* A log sink for monitoring your cluster and namespace logs.
* A metric sink for monitoring your cluster metrics.

<%= vars.product_short %> clusters include an observability manager that manages
log sink and metric sink configurations within a cluster. 

The following diagram details <%= vars.product_short %> observability manager architecture:

If you want to use sinks, you must enable **Enable Log Sink Resources** or **Enable Metric Sink Resources** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. When you select these fields, Ops Manager requests that BOSH enable the observability manager with these configurations. 

For more information, see [(Optional) Logging](./installing-pks-gcp.html#syslog) in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS. 
  
## <a id="sink-architecture"></a> Log Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.product_short %> log sink aggregates workload logs and forwards them to a common log destination.

The following diagram details <%= vars.product_short %> log sink architecture:

<a href="images/log-architecture.png" target="_blank" id="sink-diagram"><img src="images/log-architecture.png" alt="Log sink architecture in PKS"></a>
<%#= original graphic is here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xFhfrNPPKrSts4U4HsAZAl1pWuHkhq4vXWN8gLGY3G8/edit#slide=id.g5df94f27fe_0_397 %>

Logs are monitored and aggregated by a set of fluent-bit daemons running as a pod on a single node. 

An event-controller collects Kubernetes API events and sends them to a second fluent-bit daemon pod for aggregation.

All aggregated log entries are marshaled to a common log destination.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sinks are added or removed, all of the fluent-bit pods are refreshed with new sink information.</p>

## <a id="metric-sink-architecture"></a> Metric Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.product_short %> metric sink aggregates workload metrics and forwards them to a common metrics destination. 
The following diagram details <%= vars.product_short %> metric sink architecture: 

<a href="images/metric-architecture.png" target="_blank" id="metric-sink-diagram"><img src="images/metric-architecture.png" alt="Metric Sink architecture in PKS"></a>

A metric sink collects and writes metrics from a cluster to specified outputs using input and output plugins.

Workload metrics are monitored by a set of third-party plugins. The plugins forward the metrics to a Telegraph service pod. 

A pair of kubelets monitor Kubernetes and forward Kubernetes metrics to a pair of Telegraph service pods. 

To define the collected unstructured metrics, a metric-controller monitors Kubernetes for custom resource definitions and forwards those definitions 
to the Telegraph services. 

The Telegraph services collect, process, and aggregate gathered metrics. All aggregated metrics are marshaled 
to an additional plugin for forwarding to a third-party application. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sinks are added or removed, all of the Telegraph pods are refreshed with new sink information.</p>
