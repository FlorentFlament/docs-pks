title: Upgrading Clusters
owner: PKS
---

This topic describes how to upgrade the version of <%= vars.product_full %> installed in your environment.  
  
When you _upgrade_ <%= vars.product_short %> you upgrade the version of PKS installed on the PKS control plane or 
on the PKS-provisioned clusters. 
When you _update_ <%= vars.product_short %>, you instead 
modify a cluster's configuration, such as modifying the number of nodes in a cluster. 
For information about updating a PKS-provisioned cluster see 
[pks update-cluster](cli/index.html#update-cluster) in the _PKS CLI_ documentation. 

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

When upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, you can choose one of the following approaches:

* Upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and all <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters simultaneously.
This is the default behavior of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
* Upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and then upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters separately.
If you want to upgrade your clusters separately, do the following:
  1. Review [Limitations](#limitations).
  1. Complete the steps listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
  1. Complete the steps listed in [Upgrade Clusters](#upgrade-clusters).

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When <%= vars.product_short %> is set to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and
    not the clusters, the Kubernetes cluster version falls behind the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version.
    If the clusters fall more than one version behind the tile,
    <%= vars.product_short %> cannot upgrade the clusters.
    The clusters must be upgraded to match the <%= vars.product_short %> tile version before the next tile upgrade.</p>

For more information about <%= vars.product_short %> upgrades,
see [What Happens During <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before upgrading Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.product_short %>, you must do the following:

* Disable **Upgrade all clusters errand** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. For more information, see [Modify Errand Configuration in the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile](#disable-errand) below.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile or update your tile configuration, with <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> disabled,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next upgrade or configuration update.</p>
* Install the PKS command line interface (CLI) v1.7. For more information, see [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html).
* Log in to <%= vars.product_short %> using `pks login`. For more information, see [Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html).

###<a name='disable-errand'></a> Modify Errand Configuration in the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

To modify errand configuration when upgrading your <%= vars.product_short %> version, perform the steps below.
For more information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>](upgrade-pks.html).

1. If you have not already, import the product file for the new <%= vars.product_short %> version to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.
1. In the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, navigate to the **Errands** pane.
1. Disable **Upgrade all clusters errand** and click **Save**.
  ![Errands pane](images/disable-upgrade-all-clusters-errand.png)
1. Return to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** and click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Select <%= vars.product_short %> and any other products that you want to deploy and click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='upgrade-clusters'></a>Upgrade Clusters

You can upgrade your <%= vars.product_tile %> tile 
separately from upgrading your <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters.  

After upgrading your <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, upgrade individual or multiple 
clusters using the following procedures:

* [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster)  
* [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi)

To monitor or stop a cluster upgrade, follow the procedures in 
[Manage Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job](#manage-upgrade), below.


###<a id='upgrade-cluster'></a>Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-cluster` for upgrading an individual <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes cluster. 

To upgrade an individual Kubernetes cluster, 
run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME
```
Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster you want to upgrade.

To upgrade multiple clusters, see [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi), below.  

For more information about the `pks upgrade-cluster` command, see [pks upgrade-cluster](cli/index.html#upgrade-cluster) in the _PKS CLI_ documentation.    

###<a id='upgrade-clusters-multi'></a>Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-clusters` for upgrading multiple <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes clusters. 
You can upgrade clusters serially, serially with some clusters designated as canary clusters, or entirely in parallel.  

To upgrade a single cluster, see [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster) above.

For more information about the `pks upgrade-clusters` command, see [pks upgrade-clusters](cli/index.html#upgrade-clusters) in the _PKS CLI_ documentation.    

####<a id='upgrade-clusters-parallel'></a> Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters in Parallel

To upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters, run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-clusters --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --max-in-flight CLUSTER-COUNT --wait
```
Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade. 

* `CLUSTER-COUNT` is the maximum number of clusters to upgrade in parallel within an an AZ.  
    * If the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list is longer than the `CLUSTER-COUNT`, the first set of clusters are upgraded in parallel and
    subsequent clusters are queued and then upgraded in parallel as the preceding cluster upgrades complete.  
    * If an upgrade fails for a cluster in the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list, the job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
    * To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with a <code>--max-in-flight</code> 
      argument less than your BOSH Director > Director Config > <strong>Director Workers</strong> value. 
      For example, if your <strong>Director Workers</strong> value remains the default of <code>5</code>, 
      run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with a <code>--max-in-flight</code> argument value less than <code>5</code>.
    </p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>max-in-flight</code> is an optional argument. 
      If <code>max-in-flight</code> is not set, <%= vars.product_short %> uses the default 
      <code>max-in-flight</code> value of <code>1</code> and the clusters are upgraded serially.
    </p>

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks upgrade-clusters --clusters k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001,k8-cluster-002 --max-in-flight 2  --wait
<br>
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete
<br>
Continue? (y/n):y
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002
Upgrade task d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60 is done.
</pre>

####<a id='upgrade-clusters-errors'></a> Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters With Canaries

To upgrade multiple clusters and automatically stop upgrading clusters if a cluster upgrade fails, 
specify your cluster list as canary clusters. 
You can specify one or more clusters as canary clusters.  

To upgrade multiple clusters with one or more canary clusters, run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-clusters --canaries CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --wait
```
Where:

* `CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade as canary clusters. 

* `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of Kubernetes clusters to upgrade if all canary clusters successfully upgrade.
    * The specified canary clusters are upgraded prior to upgrading the clusters in your `CLUSTER-NAMES` list.  
    * Canary clusters are always upgraded serially.
    * If an upgrade fails for a canary cluster, the entire `upgrade-clusters` job stops. 
    * If an upgrade fails for a cluster in the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list, the `upgrade-clusters` job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
    * To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>--clusters</code> is a required argument. 
    To configure <code>upgrade-clusters</code> to stop for any cluster upgrade failure, 
    specify only one cluster in your <code>CLUSTER-NAMES</code> list and 
    the remaining clusters in your <code>CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES</code> list.
    </p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Canary clusters are always upgraded serially. 
      Only the clusters specified in the <code>--clusters</code> list are upgraded in parallel 
      when you run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with both <code>--canaries</code> and 
      <code>--max-in-flight</code> arguments.
    </p>

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks upgrade-clusters --canaries k8-cluster-dev,k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001  --clusters k8-cluster-002  --wait
<br>
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-dev k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete

Continue? (y/n):y
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-001
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-dev
Upgrading cluster failed: k8-cluster-dev
Upgrade task ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac is done.
</pre>


###<a id='manage-upgrade'></a> Manage Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job

You can use the PKS CLI to monitor and manage your <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster 
upgrade jobs.  

####<a id='monitor-upgrades'></a> Monitor the Status of Your Kubernetes Clusters

To review the status of the actions being performed on your clusters, 
run the following command:

```
pks clusters
```

For example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ pks clusters

</pre>

####<a id='monitor-upgrade-job'></a> Monitor the Status of Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job

To review the status of your `upgrade-clusters` job, run the following command:

```
pks task TASKID
```
Where `TASKID` is the ID of the task that was returned when you ran `pks upgrade-clusters`.

For example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ pks task ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac
<br>
Your upgrade task is: done

</pre>

####<a id='stop-upgrade-job'></a> Stop Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job

To cancel a running `upgrade-clusters` job, run the following PKS CLI command:

```
pks cancel-task TASKID
```
Where `TASKID` is the ID of the task that was returned when you ran `pks upgrade-clusters`.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>pks cancel-task</code> does not cancel cluster upgrades currently in progress. This command only cancels a job's pending cluster upgrades.
</p>

##<a id='limitations'></a> Limitations

If you upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only
and then attempt to resize or update your existing Kubernetes clusters,
these operations fail until you upgrade the clusters.

If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %>
tile and your existing Kubernetes clusters simultaneously,
do not disable **Upgrade all clusters errand** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
