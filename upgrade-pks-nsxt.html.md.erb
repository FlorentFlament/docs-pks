This topic explains how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> for environments using vSphere with NSX-T.

## <a id="before"></a>Before You Upgrade

This section describes the activities you must perform before upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>.

### <a id="compatiblity-chart"></a>Consult Compatibility Charts

For information about PKS with NSX-T and Ops Manager compatibility, see the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html).

### <a id="upgrade-path"></a> Determine Your Upgrade Path

For information about the supported upgrade path, see _Updgrade Path_ section of the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html#v1.4.0-upgrade).

### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

If you have not already, complete all of the steps in the [Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PKS v1.4](checklist.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4 and NSX-T v2.4.

### <a id="upgrade-pks-to-140"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to PKS v1.4.0

Upgrade the PKS tile from a supported version to to PKS v1.4.0. When you upgrade the PKS tile, the target version of NCP is installed (v2.4.0 in this case). This must be done before you upgrade to NSX-T v2.4.x. 

If you are performing the upgrade during a maintenance window, it is not necessary to upgrade the Kubernetes clusters at this time, so you can deselect the upgrade all clusters errand for PKS. However, if you want your Kubernetes clusters to be upgraded immediately, ensure that the upgrade all clusters errand is enabled.
 
To upgrade the PKS tile to v1.3.6:

1. Download the PKS v1.3.6 tile from the Pivotal Network. 
2. Upload the PKS v1.3.6 tile to Ops Manager. 
3. Stage the 1.3.6 tile for deployment.
4. Review pending changes.
5. Apply changes.

### <a id="upgrade-nsxt"></a> Step 3: Upgrade from NSX-T v2.3.1 to NSX-T v2.4

Upgrade NSX-T from v2.3.1 to v2.4.0.1. You must use at least version v2.4.0.1 due to the following known issue in v2.4.0: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/67449. See the **Upgrade Path** section of the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) for information on obtaining the hot-patch.

To perform the upgrade, refer to [Upgrading NSX-T Data Center](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/upgrade/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html) in the VMware documentation.

NSX-T v2.4.x supports the following vSphere versions with patches:
- VMware vSphere 6.7 EP06 (Release name: ESXi670-201901001) is the minimum supported version with NSX-T 2.4.0 (KB 2143832)
- VMware vSphere 6.5 P03 (Release Name: ESXi650-201811002) is the minimum supported version with NSX-T 2.4.0 (KB 2143832)

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsx-upgrade/nsx_24_upgrade-01.png" alt="Supported vSphere versions for NSX-T 2.4.0"> 

Refer to the [VMware Product Interoperability Matrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&175=&1=). For example, hover over the Information icon for vSphere 6.7 U1 and NSX-T 2.4 and you will see the following message: "VMware vSphere 6.7 EP06 (Release name: ESXi670-201901001) is the minimum supported version with NSX-T 2.4.0 (KB 2143832)."

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsx-upgrade/nsx_24_upgrade-02.png" alt="Supported vSphere versions for NSX-T 2.4.0">

For details on the ESXi v6.7 U1 EP06 patch, refer to the VMware KB article [Build numbers and versions of VMware ESXi/ESX](
https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2143832?CoveoV2.CoveoLightningApex.getInitializationData=1&r=2&ui-communities-components-aura-components-forceCommunity-seoAssistant.SeoAssistant.getSeoData=1&other.KM_Utility.getArticleDetails=1&other.KM_Utility.getArticleMetadata=2&other.KM_Utility.getUrl=1&other.KM_Utility.getUser=1&other.KM_Utility.getAllTranslatedLanguages=2&ui-comm-runtime-components-aura-components-siteforce-qb.Quarterback.validateRoute=1).

To perform the patch upgrade using vCenter, refer to the [vSphere Upgrade Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.update_manager.doc/GUID-EF6BEE4C-4583-4A8C-81B9-5B074CA2E272.html) documentation for guidance on applying the patch. See also the [VMware ESXi Upgrade](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-122035F6-8433-463E-A0F7-B4FC71A05B04.html) documentation for additional details. To patch ESXi hosts in an air-gapped environment, use Zip files as described in [the VMware ESXi documenation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-22A4B153-CB21-47B4-974E-2E5BB8AC6874.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Before upgrading NSX-T, make sure you are on the supported vSphere and patch version. NSX-T v2.4.x supports the following vSphere versions with patches: VMware vSphere 6.7 EP06 (Release name: ESXi670-201901001) is the minimum supported version with NSX-T 2.4.0 (KB 2143832) VMware vSphere 6.5 P03 (Release Name: ESXi650-201811002) is the minimum supported version with NSX-T 2.4.0 (KB 2143832). </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When upgrading NSX-T, at the stage that the ESXi Transport Nodes are upgraded ("Hosts"), you may want to create a different host group for each ESXi host in the correct order so that hosts in maintenance mode only get upgraded. In vCenter, put each EXSi Transport Node (TN) host into maintenance mode, 1 at a time. Create the host group for that ESXi host and upgrade only it, then remove it from maintenance mode. Repeat this process for all ESXi TN hosts.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Once you upgrade to NSX-T 2.4, the T0 router(s) and all other management plane objects can be seen only from the <em>Advanced Networking Configuration</em> tab. They will not be migrated to the new Policy UI.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are architectural changes in NSX 2.4. The NSX Controller is now a component of the NSX Manager. Once the NSX-T upgrade is complete, you will have a single NSX-T Manager node. Power off the NSX Controllers. At the end of the upgrade, you can delete the NSX Controller VMs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/upgrade/GUID-D946F58F-BFB2-4F8E-A979-4C07393299E8.html">Delete NSX Controllers</a> in the NSX-T documentation.</p> 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Once the upgrade to NSX 2.4 is complete, you may want to verify that your PKS environment is functioning properly by logging in to PKS and creating a small test cluster. If you cannot do this, troubleshoot the upgrade before proceeding. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/upgrade/GUID-260D52CB-1B88-4138-A853-0293A7A3B077.html#GUID-260D52CB-1B88-4138-A853-0293A7A3B077">Troubleshooting Upgrade Failures</a> in the NSX-T documentation.</p>


### <a id="upgrade-nsxt-2.2"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to NSX-T v2.2

Skip this step if you are already running NSX-T v2.2.

To upgrade to NSX-T v2.2, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.2/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html) in the VMware documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 3: Upgrade to v2.3.1+

Before you upgrade to PKS v1.2.5, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+.

1. Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops) or [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 4: Upgrade to PKS v1.3.x

Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/upgrade-pks-nsxt.html) in the PKS v1.3 documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 5: Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically.
Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Browse to the <%= vars.product_short %> product file and select it. Uploading the file takes several minutes.
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-2.png" alt="Upload PKS product file to Ops Manager">

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**. This adds the tile to your staging area.<br><br>
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-3.png" alt="Import the PKS product file">

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Step 6: Download and Import the Stemcell

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial).

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %>, the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell,
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click on the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate **<%= vars.product_tile %>** and note the required stemcell version.

1. Visit the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network,
and download the required stemcell version for vSphere.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, and click on **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-5.png" alt="Import stemcell">

1. Select the <%= vars.product_tile %> product and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-6.png" alt="Apply stemcell to PKS">

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-7.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-8.png" alt="Verify status is green">

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a> Step 6: Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, perform the following steps.

1. In the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the listed errands are configured as follows:
  * **NSX-T Validation errand**: Set to **On**
  * **Upgrade all clusters errand**: Set to **Default (On)**
  * **Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand**: Set to **Default (Off)**
  * **Run smoke tests**: Set to **On**. The errand uses the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you set the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>, your Kubernetes cluster version will fall behind the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version. If your clusters fall more than one version behind the tile, you can no longer upgrade the clusters. You must upgrade your clusters to match the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version before the next tile upgrade.</p>

1. If you make any changes, click **Save**.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Step 7: Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id="upgrade-nsxt-2.3"></a> Step 7: Upgrade to NSX-T v2.3

NSX-T v2.3 is the recommended version of NSX-T to use with <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.

To upgrade to NSX-T v2.3, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading NSX-T Data Center](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html).

## <a id="post-upgrade"></a> After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x and NSX-T v2.3, complete the following verifications and upgrades.

### <a id="update-clis""></a> Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

To update your CLIs, download and re-install the PKS and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.product_short %> on Pivotal Network.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

### <a id="verify"></a> Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and the upgrade is complete,
verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy and confirm that NCP is
running on the master node VM.

To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment and NCP, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html).

### <a id="vsphere"></a>(Optional) Upgrade vSphere

If you are deploying <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX&#8209;T, consult the chart below, and upgrade vSphere if necessary.
Upgrade vSphere from version 6.5 or 6.5 U1 to 6.5 U2 or 6.7.
