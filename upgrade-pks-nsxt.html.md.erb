<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for environments using vSphere with NSX-T.

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.2.5 and later. <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x is compatible with Ops Manager v2.3.1 or later and Ops Manager v2.4.x.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Upgrading from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.2.5+ to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x causes all certificates to be automatically regenerated. The old certificate authority is still trusted, and has a validity of one year. But the new certificates are signed with a new certificate authority, which is valid for four years.</p>

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3 with NSX-T v2.3.

### <a id="upgrade-pks-1.1.5"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.5 or Later

Skip this step if you are already running <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.5+.

Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/upgrade-pks-nsxt.html) in the PKS v1.1 documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PKS v1.1.5 with NSX-T introduces architectural changes that require larger sized worker node VMs. Before you upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or later, you must increase the size of the Kubernetes worker node VM. For more information on how to increase the worker node VM size, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/upgrade-pks.html#upgrade-tile">Increase the Kubernetes Worker Node VM Size</a> in the PKS v1.1 documentation. For more information about the architectural changes in PKS v1.1.5 with NSX-T, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/release-notes.html#arch-changes">NSX-T Architectural Changes</a> in the PKS v1.1.5 Release Notes.
</p>

### <a id="upgrade-nsxt-2.2"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to NSX-T v2.2

Skip this step if you are already running NSX-T v2.2.

To upgrade to NSX-T v2.2, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.2/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html) in the VMware documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 3: Upgrade to v2.3.1+

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.2.5, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+.

1. Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops) or [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 4: Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically.
Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Browse to the <%= vars.product_short %> product file and select it. Uploading the file takes several minutes.
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-2.png" alt="Upload PKS product file to Ops Manager">

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**. This adds the tile to your staging area.<br><br>
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-3.png" alt="Import the PKS product file">

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Step 5: Download and Import the Stemcell

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial).

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %>, the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell,
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile, click on the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate **<%= vars.product_tile %>** and note the required stemcell version.

1. Visit the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network,
and download the required stemcell version for vSphere.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, and click on **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-5.png" alt="Import stemcell">

1. Select the <%= vars.product_short %> product and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-6.png" alt="Apply stemcell to PKS">

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell.

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.
    <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-8.png" alt="Verify status is green">

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a> Step 6: Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, perform the following steps.

1. In the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the listed errands are configured as follows:
  * **NSX-T Validation errand**: Set to **On**
  * **Upgrade all clusters errand**: Set to **Default (On)**
  * **Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand**: Set to **Default (Off)**
  * **Run smoke tests**: Set to **On**. The errand uses the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you set the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>, your Kubernetes cluster version will fall behind the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version. If your clusters fall more than one version behind the tile, you can no longer upgrade the clusters. You must upgrade your clusters to match the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version before the next tile upgrade.</p>

1. If you make any changes, click **Save**.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Step 6: Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id="upgrade-nsxt-2.3"></a> Step 7: Upgrade to NSX-T v2.3

NSX-T v2.3 is the recommended version of NSX-T to use with <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.

To upgrade to NSX-T v2.3, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading NSX-T Data Center](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html).

## <a id="post-upgrade"></a> After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.3.x and NSX-T v2.3, complete the following verifications and upgrades.

### <a id="update-clis""></a> Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

To update your CLIs, download and re-install the PKS and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.product_short %> on Pivotal Network.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

### <a id="verify"></a> Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and the upgrade is complete,
verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy and confirm that NCP is
running on the master node VM.

To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment and NCP, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html).

### <a id="vsphere"></a>(Optional) Upgrade vSphere
