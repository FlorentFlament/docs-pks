### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin upgrading the PKS tile, perform the following steps:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version or versions of PKS you are upgrading to.

1. Review [What Happens During PKS Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html), and consider your workload capacity and uptime requirements.

1. View your workload resource usage in Dashboard. For more information, see [Accessing Dashboard](access-dashboard.html).
  1. If workers are operating too close to their capacity, the PKS upgrade can fail. To prevent workload downtime during a cluster upgrade, Pivotal recommends running your workload on at least three worker VMs, using multiple replicas of your workloads spread across those VMs. For more information, see [Maintaining Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).
  1. If your clusters are near capacity for your existing infrastructure, Pivotal recommends scaling up your clusters before you upgrade.
Scale up your cluster by running `pks resize` or create a cluster using a larger plan. For more information, see [Scaling Existing Clusters](scale-clusters.html).

1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verify Kubernetes Health](verify-health.html#k8s).

1. (Optional) Back up the PKS v1.1 control plane. For more information, see "Backing up the PKS Control Plane" in the [PKS v1.1 documentation (PDF)](https://docs.pivotal.io/archives/pks-1-1.pdf).

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or Later

Skip this step if you are already running PKS v1.1.5+.

Follow the procedures detailed in "Upgrading PKS" in the [PKS v1.1 documentation (PDF)](https://docs.pivotal.io/archives/pks-1-1.pdf).

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+

Skip this step if you are already running Ops Manager v2.3.1+.

Before you upgrade to PKS v1.2.x, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+.
 
1. Follow the procedures in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to PKS v1.2.x.

### <a id="upgrade-tile"></a> Step 3: Upgrade to PKS v1.2.6

You can upgrade both PKS v1.1.5 and PKS v1.1.6 to PKS v1.2.6.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: PKS v1.2.8 and earlier include a critical CVE. When upgrading to PKS versions beyond 1.2.5 it is critical that you implement and maintain an ETCD certificate trust chain. Follow the procedures in the <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/pks-upgrade-approach-for-critical-cve">PKS upgrade approach for CRITICAL CVE: 2019-3779 (67116)</a> article in the Pivotal Support Knowledge Base to perform an upgrade to PKS v1.2.9.
</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> PKS versions v1.2.4 and earlier must first be upgraded to either PKS v1.2.6 or PKS v1.2.5 before upgrading to PKS v1.2.7.
</p>

#### <a id="import"></a> Import the Tile

1. Review the [PKS Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the PKS v1.2.6 tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **Pivotal Container Service**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> During an upgrade your existing configuration settings automatically migrate to the new version.</p>

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Step 4: Download and Import the Stemcell

PKS v1.2.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial). 

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for PKS, the PKS tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell, the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the **Pivotal Container Service** tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate Pivotal Container Service and note the required stemcell version.

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a> Step 5: Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the PKS tile, perform the following steps.

1. Click the newly-added **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**. The errand upgrades a single Kubernetes cluster at a time. Upgrading PKS Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service, as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you are upgrading PKS, you must enable the <strong>Upgrade All Clusters</strong> errand.</p>

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade PKS, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the PKS tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Step 6: Apply Changes to the PKS Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade to the PKS tile.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
