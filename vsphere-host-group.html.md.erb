This topic describes how to use vSphere Host Groups with <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="host-groups-about"></a>About vSphere Host Groups

In vSphere, a cluster is a collection of EXSi servers that run virtual machines (VMs). A typical way to organize resources within a cluster is using resource pools. A resource pool is a collection of vSphere resources.

Another way to segment resources within a cluster is using host groups. This means that within a cluster object you can specify certain ESXi hosts to be part of a host group.

<%= vars.product_short %> users can define host groups in vSphere, then in the PKS tile can specify the host group. Host groups align with the Availability Zone (AZ) construct in BOSH, and allow for stretch vSAN clustering.

For more information on vSphere host groups, refer to the [vSphere documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-67-availability-guide.pdf?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIGoFkD0AJA9gZwC4AIDiATmgK4AOGIAvkA).

## <a id="host-groups-uses"></a>Host Group Use Cases for <%= vars.product_short %>

This subsection describes use cases for using host groups with <%= vars.product_short %>.

### Enabling Stretched Clusters

With this use case, for data protection purposes, Kubernetes nodes disks components and PVs will be replicated across the two sites. Kubernetes node VMs can be placed in one site or in both, depending on how the plan is configured (1 AZ checked or 2 AZs checked).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%= vars.product_short %> supports the default Storage Policy Based Management set on vCenter for vSAN. The number of **Failures to Tolerate** (FTT) must be set to 1 to perform data replication across the two sites.</p>

### Enabling Support for vSAN FDs

For this use case, Kubernetes master nodes must run on separate ESXi hosts groups. Kubernetes nodes disks components and PVs will be replicated across two different AZs (vSAN only).

### Using HostGroup as a New AZ in BOSH

TBD

## <a id="host-groups-reqs"></a>Requirements for Using Host Groups with <%= vars.product_short %>

Host groups are enabled in the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) for Ops Manager 2.5.0. 
To use host groups with <%= vars.product_short %>, you must upgrade or install Ops Manager 2.5.

## <a id="host-groups-define"></a>Defining a Host Group in vSphere

To implement host groups with <%= vars.product_short %>, the first step is to define a host group in vSphere.

1. Log in to vCenter.
1. Select the compute **Cluster**.
1. Select the **Configure** tab.
1. Under **Configuration**, select **VM/Host Groups**.
1. Click **Add** and configure the host group as follows:
  - Name: Enter a name for the host group.
  - Type: Select **Host Group** from the drop down.
  - Click **Add** and select the ESXi host(s) to include in the host group. 
  - Click **OK**.
1. Once done, you should see that the host group is configured.

## <a id="host-groups-use"></a>Using a Host Group with <%= vars.product_short %>

Once the host group is defined in vSphere, the next step is to declare this host group when defining the BOSH Availability Zone (AZ) for use with <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Log in to Ops Manager.
1. Select the BOSH Director tile.
1. Select the **Create Availability Zones** tab.
1. Select the desired AZ, or create a new one.
1. In the **Clusters** section, enter the name of the **Host Group**.
1. Click **Save**.
