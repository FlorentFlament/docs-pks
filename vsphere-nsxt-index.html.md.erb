This topic provides the workflow for installing <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center.

##<a id='step01'> Step 1: Prepare to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

In preparation for installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T, review all of the topics in the subsection [Preparing to Install Enterprise PKS on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](./vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html).

##<a id='step02'> Step 2: Install and Configure NSX-T Data Center for <%= vars.product_short %>

Complete the instructions in the subsection <a href="nsxt-install-config-steps.html">Installing and Configuring NSX-T for Enterprise PKS</a>.

##<a id='step03'></a> Step 3: Create the Management Plane for <%= vars.product_short %>

Prepare the vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure for the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane where the PKS API, Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and Harbor Registry VMs are deployed. This includes a vSphere resource pool for <%= vars.product_short %> management components, an NSX Tier-1 (T1) Logical Switch, an NSX Tier-1 Logical Router and Port, and NAT rules (if you are using NAT mode). 

For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html">Creating the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane</a>.

##<a id='step04'></a> Step 4: Create the Compute Plane for <%= vars.product_short %>

Create vSphere Resource Pools for the Availability Zones where you will deploy Kubernetes clusters. These resource pools map to the AZs you will create when you configure BOSH Director and reference when you install the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. 

Create IP blocks for the [node networks](#nodes-ip-block) and the [pod networks](#pods-ip-block). The subnets for both nodes and pods should have a size of 256 (/16). See [Plan IP Blocks](#plan-ip-blocks) and [Reserved IP Blocks](#reserved-ip-blocks) for details.

Create a Floating IP Pool from which to assign routable IP addresses to components. This network provides your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by <%= vars.product_short %>. The network also provides IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services.

For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-prepare-compute-plane.html">Creating the <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Plane</a>.

##<a id='step05'> Step 5: Prepare to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

Deploy a supported version of Ops Manager on the NSX-T Management Plane network.

For instructions, see <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html">Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='step06'> Step 6: Generate the NSX-T Management Cluster Root CA Certificate and Key

Generate the CA Cert for the NSX Manager and import the certificate to NSX Manager.

For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-generate-ca-cert.html">Generating and Registering the NSX-T Management Root CA Certificate for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='step07'> Step 7: Configure BOSH Director for vSphere with NSX-T

Create BOSH availability zones (AZs) that map to the Management and Compute resource pools in vSphere, and the Management and Control plane networks in NSX-T.

For instructions, see <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='step08'></a> Step 8: Generate and Register the NSX-T Management Cluster Super User Principal Identity Certificate and Key

Generate the NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate and register it with the NSX Manager using the NSX API.

##<a id='step09'> Step 9: Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

At this point your NSX-T environment is prepared for <%= vars.product_short %> installation using the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile in Ops Manager. 

For instructions, see <a href="./installing-nsx-t.html">Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

##<a id='step10'></a> Step 10: Install Harbor Harbor Registry for <%= vars.product_short %>

The VMware Harbor Registry is recommended for <%= vars.product_short %>. Install Harbor in the NSX Management Plane with other <%= vars.product_short %> components (PKS API, Ops Manager, and BOSH).

For instructions, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vmware-harbor/installing.html">Installing VMware Harbor Registry</a>.

If you are using the [NAT deployment topology](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat), create a DNAT rule that maps the private Harbor IP address to a routable IP address from the floating IP pool on the PKS management network. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vmware-harbor/integrating-pks.html#create-dnat">Create DNAT Rule</a>.

##<a id='step11'> Step 11: Install the PKS and Kubectl CLIs 

See <a href="./installing-pks-cli.html">Installing the PKS CLI</a> and <a href="./installing-kubectl-cli.html">Installing the Kubernetes CLI</a>.

##<a id='step12'> Step 12: Create Admin Users for <%= vars.product_short %>

See <a href="vsphere-configure-pks-users.html">Setting Up <%= vars.product_short %> Admin Users on vSphere</a>  

##<a id='step13'> Step 13: Verify the Installation

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the PKS CLI. For instructions, see [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pks/1-5/create-cluster.html#create).

Deploy a simple workload to the Kubernetes cluster. For instructions, see [Deploy Workloads on vSphere with NSX-T](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pks/1-5/deploy-workloads.html#external-lb-nsxt).

##<a id='step14'> Step 14: Perform Desired Post-Installation Configurations

After you have installed <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T, refer to the following subsection for topics describing additional NSX-T configuration options: [Advanced Configurations for Enterprise PKS on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](./vsphere-nsxt-index-adv.html)

##<a id='step15'> Step 15: Create Network Profiles to Customize Cluster Deployments

Network profiles let you provide customized deployment templates for Kubernetes clusters. See [Defining and Using Network Profiles](./network-profiles-index.html) for details.
