This topic describes the version requirements for installing Pivotal Container
Service (PKS) on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

For prerequisites and resource requirements for installing PKS on vSphere without NSX-T
integration, see
[vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html).

For hardware and resource requirements for deploying PKS on vSphere with NSX-T
in production environments, see [Hardware Requirements for PKS on vSphere with NSX-T](./vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html).

PKS supports air-gapped deployments on vSphere with or without NSX-T integration.

You can also configure integration with the Harbor tile, an enterprise-class registry server for
container images. For more information, see
[VMware Harbor Registry](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vmware-harbor/index.html) in the
_Pivotal Partner documentation_.
