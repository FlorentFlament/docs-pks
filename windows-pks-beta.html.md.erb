title: Configuring Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Clusters (Beta)
owner: PKS
windowsbeta: true

This topic describes configuring Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters in <%= vars.product_full %>.  

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

In <%= vars.product_short %> you can provision a Windows worker-based Kubernetes cluster on vSphere with Flannel.  

To provision a Windows worker-based Kubernetes cluster:  

1. Verify your environment meets the Windows worker-based Kubernetes cluster [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).  
1. [Configure a Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Cluster](#install).  
1. [Upload the Windows Server Stemcell](#upload-stemcell).  
1. [Create a Windows Worker-Based Cluster](#create-cluster).  

<p class="note warning"> <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> Support for Windows-based Kubernetes clusters is in beta 
and supports only vSphere with Flannel. <br><br>Do not enable this feature if you are using <%= vars.product_short %> 1.5 
with vSphere with NSX-T, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure, or Amazon Web Services (AWS).<br>
</p>

We are actively looking for feedback on this beta feature. To submit feedback, send an email to pcf-windows@pivotal.io. 
 

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites
The following are required for creating a Windows worker-based Kubernetes cluster in <%= vars.product_short %> 1.5:  

* Your vSphere environment meets the [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html).  
* <%= vars.product_short %> must be installed in a vSphere with Flannel environment.  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> NSX-T does not support networking Windows containers. 
      If this is a key requirement for you, submit feedback by sending an email to pcf-windows@pivotal.io.
    </p>
* <%= vars.product_short %> has been configured as described in [Installing Enterprise PKS on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html).  
* You must have a vSphere stemcell 2019.7 for Windows Server version 2019.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> vSphere Windows Server stemcells are not available on the 
    	<a href="https://network.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Network</a>.  vSphere Windows Server stemcells must be created by using Stembuild 
    	and your own Windows Server ISO. For information about creating vSphere Windows Server stemcells, see 
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/windows/stemcells.html#stemcell">Windows Stemcells</a> 
    in <i>Downloading or Creating Windows Stemcells</i>.
    </p>

### <a id='networking'></a> Networking
<%= partial 'networking-vsphere' %>

### <a id='upload-stemcell'></a> Upload the Windows Server Stemcell
1. When prompted by Ops Manager to upload a stemcell, follow the instructions and provide your previously created 
vSphere stemcell 2019.7 for Windows Server version 2019. 

## <a id='create-cluster'></a> Create a Windows Worker-Based Cluster

1. To create a Windows worker-based cluster follow the steps in [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html).
